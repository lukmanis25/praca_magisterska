To graduate from the university, students must complete all the semesters in accordance with the curriculum, including obligatory training courses and internships, and obtain ECTS credits as provided for in the study program of a given course. For master's degree studies, students must also obtain a positive evaluation of the diploma thesis.

The final grade of the diploma thesis, engineering diploma project, engineering diploma thesis, or bachelor diploma thesis is determined by the average of the positive grades given by the supervisor and the reviewer, rounded up pursuant to §16(1), based on the table below:

* very good: w ≥ 4.50
* good plus: 4.10 ≤ w < 4.50
* good: 3.70 ≤ w < 4.10
* satisfactory plus: 3.30 ≤ w < 3.70
* satisfactory: 3.00 ≤ w < 3.30

If the assessment is negative, the dean will appoint an additional reviewer or a commission (grading commission) to assess the thesis in question. The negative reassessment is final.

The diploma examination takes place within two months from the date of fulfillment of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1. The diploma examination is an oral examination which is assessed in accordance with the scale defined in §16(1), and then rounded to binding grades.

To graduate from the university, students need to complete all the required subjects and obtain the necessary number of ECTS credits as specified in the curriculum. They must also pass the diploma examination and, in the case of master's degree studies, obtain a positive evaluation of the diploma thesis.

The condition for completing studies and obtaining the diploma of completion of studies is: obtaining the learning outcomes and the number of ECTS points specified in the curriculum, passing the diploma examination and positive evaluation of the diploma thesis in the case of master's degree and uniform master's studies, and in the case of bachelor's degree studies if this is required by the study program.

Once a student has met these conditions, they can graduate from the university. The diploma is awarded to students who have completed their studies and have met all the requirements.

To graduate from the university, students must complete all the required semesters in accordance with the curriculum, including obligatory training courses and internships, and obtain ECTS credits as provided for in the study program of a given course. In the case of master's degree studies, students must also obtain a positive evaluation of the diploma thesis.

The final results of studies are calculated with accuracy to the nearest two decimal places after the decimal point, in accordance with the following formula:

* For bachelor's degree studies: w = 0.8a + 0.2c
* For master's degree studies: w = 0.6a + 0.3b + 0.1c

Where:
a - is the final weighted grade average in accordance with the rules stipulated in §16,
b - is a positive grade for the diploma thesis,
c - is a positive grade for the diploma examination.

The final result of studies is entered in the diploma in accordance with the following credit scale:

* Credit scale:
        + w ≥ 4.50: Final grade for studies - very good
        + 4.10 ≤ w < 4.50: Final grade for studies - good plus
        + 3.70 ≤ w < 4.10: Final grade for studies - good
        + 3.30 ≤ w < 3.70: Final grade for studies - satisfactory plus
        + 3.00 ≤ w < 3.30: Final grade for studies - satisfactory
        + 2.00 ≤ w < 3.00: Final grade for studies - unsatisfactory
        + w < 2.00: Final grade for studies - failed

In justified cases, the diploma examination committee may raise the final grade calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3 by half a grade.
