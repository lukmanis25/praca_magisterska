You are designing an evaluation set for a knowledge-intensive language model.

Given the following summaries of a knowledge base, your task is to:
1. Identify **3 potential users** who would meaningfully interact with this dataset.
2. For each user, describe **3 specific tasks** they would perform using this dataset.
3. For each (user, task) combination, generate **3 high-level questions** that require a deep, holistic understanding of the dataset.

Summarized knowledge base:
"""
<INSERT YOUR SUMMARIES HERE>
"""

Output format:
- User 1: [brief user description]
    - Task 1: [short description]
        - Question 1:
        - Question 2:
        - Question 3:
    - Task 2: ...
    - Task 3: ...
- User 2: ...
- User 3: ...
