Read the text below and generate exactly 3 open-ended questions in English that meet all of the following criteria:

1. Each question must be directly and explicitly supported by the content of the text only, without relying on any external knowledge or assumptions.
2. Each question must be specific and detailed, reflecting a deep understanding of the text.
3. Questions must be single-part only (no compound or multi-clause questions); avoid using "and", "or", or combining causes with consequences.
4. Use clear, formal academic language to construct each question.

For each question, provide a thorough and precise expected answer that:
- Is based strictly on the information in the text.
- Explains why this answer is correct, referring to specific evidence or phrases from the text.
- Is written in a complete, well-structured sentence or short paragraph (do not use bullet points or fragments).

Do not infer or speculate beyond what is explicitly stated in the text.
