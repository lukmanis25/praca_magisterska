When determining the weighted average of grades, courses that were not assigned ECTS credits or\nwere passed without a grade are omitted.\n11. The weighted average of the grades for the semester is calculated taking into account the grades in\nall subjects. Missing grades in subjects result in no weighted average for a given semester.\n\nVI.\n\nINDIVIDUAL STUDY PLAN AND CURRICULUM\n\n§17\n1.\n\nStudents may take an individual study plan or curriculum based on the rules defined by the dean.\n\n2.\n\nThe dean may agree to individual study plans particularly for students who:\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n\nobtained a high grade point average after the first semester (or subsequent ones) in the case of\nbachelor’s degree studies or obtained a high grade point average in bachelor’s degree studies in\nthe case of master’s degree studies, subject to paragraph 3;\nhave documented scientific achievements or are involved in research and development work of\nR&D teams operating at the university;\npursue part of their studies at another university;\nwant to pursue individual research studies, including individual -interdisciplinary studies.\n\n3.\n\nFor students who are winners of the \"Gdańsk University of Technology Talent Scholarship\"\ncompetition, the dean may consent to studies with an individual study program from the first semester\nof studies.\n\n4.\n\nDetailed conditions of studying according to an individual program of study at individual faculties are\ndetermined by the faculty rules approved by the faculty councils after obtaining a written opinion of the\nfaculty bodies of the Student Government.\n\n5.\n\nDetailed conditions for studying according to the individual research study plans are determined by\nthe rector after obtaining a written opinion from the Student Government.\n\n6.\n\nThe selection of subjects in an individual study plan has to be consistent with the learning outcomes\nestablished for a given field and for individual interdepartmental studies consistent with the learning\noutcomes in at least two areas.\n\n7.\n\nThe dean may appoint tutors for students pursuing individual curricula.\n\n8.\n\nAt the request of a pregnant student, or student who is a parent, the dean agrees for them to complete\nfull-time studies according to an individual study plan.\n\n9.\n\nAt the student's request submitted within 14 days of the beginning of the semester the dean may\nagree to individual study plans particularly for students who:\n1)\n\npursue a part of their studies at another university,\npage 10\n\n\f2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n\npursue second-cycle studies in an extended mode\npursue more than one field of study,\nhave changed their field of study or faculty,\nhave a specific level and type of disability,\nare repeating a semester and can take subjects from subsequent semesters,\nhave returned from a gap year, resumed their studies or have been transferred from another\nuniversity,\n8) are unable to", "full_doc_id": "doc-3b86eb88e6d891ebcbab8b3b5ee2aca7", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-2c67c1f6a9de439c93e08bde9451bf50", "__created_at__": 1746356661.6826453, "content": "of their studies at another university,\npage 10\n\n\f2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n\npursue second-cycle studies in an extended mode\npursue more than one field of study,\nhave changed their field of study or faculty,\nhave a specific level and type of disability,\nare repeating a semester and can take subjects from subsequent semesters,\nhave returned from a gap year, resumed their studies or have been transferred from another\nuniversity,\n8) are unable to attend classes in accordance with the study plan due to health conditions\nconfirmed by medical certificates,\n9) practice a sport in which they have achievements at the national or higher level,\n10) are active in a student organization at the university or at a higher level.\n10.
