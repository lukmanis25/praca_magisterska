There is also a mitochondrial genome, inherited exclusively from the mother, which can be involved in inherited genetic disorders. On each chromosome, there are thousands of genes that are responsible for determining the genotype and phenotype of the individual. A gene is defined as a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional product. The human haploid genome contains 3 billion base pairs and has between 20,000 and 25,000 functional genes.\n\n14.0: Prelude to DNA Structure and Function\n\nThe three letters “DNA” have now become synonymous with crime solving, paternity testing, human identification, and genetic testing. DNA can be retrieved from hair, blood, or saliva. Each person’s DNA is unique, and it is possible to detect differences between individuals within a species on the basis of these unique features.\n\nFigure  14.0.1\n : Dolly the sheep was the first large mammal to be cloned.\nThe three letters “DNA” have now become synonymous with crime solving, paternity testing, human identification, and genetic testing. DNA can be retrieved from hair, blood, or saliva. Each person’s DNA is unique, and it is possible to detect differences between individuals within a species on the basis of these unique features.\n\nDNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics. In humans, DNA testing is applied to numerous uses: determining paternity, tracing genealogy, identifying pathogens, archeological research, tracing disease outbreaks, and studying human migration patterns. In the medical field, DNA is used in diagnostics, new vaccine development, and cancer therapy. It is now possible to determine predisposition to diseases by looking at genes.\n\nEach human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes: one set of chromosomes is inherited from the mother and the other set is inherited from the father.

The human haploid genome contains 3 billion base pairs and has between 20,000 and 25,000 functional genes.\n\n14.1: Historical Basis of Modern Understanding\n\nModern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher, a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\n\nModern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure  14.1.1\n ), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\n\nFigure  14.1.1\n : Friedrich Miescher (1844–1895) discovered nucleic acids.\n\nA half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent. In 1928, he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology. He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope. The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. As a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope. Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (Figure 14.1.2\n). These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments.\n\nFigure  14.1.2\n : Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used in Griffith’s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic. The S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process. (credit \"living mouse\": modification of work by NIH; credit \"dead mouse\": modification of work by Sarah Marriage)\n\nScientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle further. They isolated the S strain from the dead\n######################\nOutput:"

set is inherited from the father. There is also a mitochondrial genome, inherited exclusively from the mother, which can be involved in inherited genetic disorders. On each chromosome, there are thousands of genes that are responsible for determining the genotype and phenotype of the individual. A gene is defined as a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional product. The human haploid genome contains 3 billion base pairs and has between 20,000 and 25,000 functional genes.\\n\\n14.0: Prelude to DNA Structure and Function\\n\\nThe three letters “DNA” have now become synonymous with crime solving, paternity testing, human identification, and genetic testing.

Each person’s DNA is unique, and it is possible to detect differences between individuals within a species on the basis of these unique features.\\n\\nDNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics. In humans, DNA testing is applied to numerous uses: determining paternity, tracing genealogy, identifying pathogens, archeological research, tracing disease outbreaks, and studying human migration patterns. In the medical field, DNA is used in diagnostics, new vaccine development, and cancer therapy. It is now possible to determine predisposition to diseases by looking at genes.\\n\\nEach human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes: one set of chromosomes is inherited from the mother and the other set is inherited from the father.

In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher, a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\\n\\nModern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (Figure  14.1.1\\n ), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.\\n\\nFigure  14.1.1\\n : Friedrich Miescher (1844–1895) discovered nucleic acids.\\n\\nA half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent. In 1928, he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology. He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope. The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. As a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope. Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (Figure 14.1.2\\n). These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments.\\n\\nFigure  14.1.2\\n : Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used in Griffith’s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic. The S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process. (credit \\\"living mouse\\\": modification of work by NIH; credit \\\"dead mouse\\\": modification of work by Sarah Marriage)\\n\\nScientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle further.

The story started with a teenage boy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the immigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities approached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and compared the samples with the boy’s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three children was compared with the boy’s DNA. He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings. He concluded that the boy was indeed the mother’s son.\n\nForensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis; most forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment. Only mitochondrial DNA is sequenced for forensics. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.\n\nExperiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, 32P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus.\n\nEach batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant. Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (Figure  14.1.3\n ).\nFigure  14.1.3\n : In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S, which labels protein, or 32P, which labels DNA. Only 32P entered the bacterial cells, indicating that DNA is the genetic material.\nAround this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found that the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is\n######################\nOutput:"

Geneticists experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.\\n\\nExperiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, 32P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus.\\n\\nEach batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32P, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant. Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (Figure  14.1.3\\n ).\\nFigure  14.1.3\\n : In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either 35S, which labels protein, or 32P, which labels DNA. Only 32P entered the bacterial cells, indicating that DNA is the genetic material.\\nAround this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found that the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C.

He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is also known as Chargaff’s rules. This finding proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix model.\n\nSummary\nDNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich Miescher, who called it nuclein because it was isolated from nuclei. Frederick Griffith's experiments with strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae provided the first hint that DNA may be the transforming principle. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria. Later experiments by Hershey and Chase using bacteriophage T2 proved that DNA is the genetic material. Chargaff found that the ratio of A = T and C = G, and that the percentage content of A, T, G, and C is different for different species.\n\n14.2: DNA Structure and Sequencing\n\nThe building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group. The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\n\nhe building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (Figure  14.2.1\n ). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\n\nIllustration depicts the structure of a nucleoside, which is made up of a pentose with a nitrogenous base attached at the 1' position. There are two kinds of nitrogenous bases: pyrimidines, which have one six-membered ring, and purines, which have a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines, and adenine and guanine are purines. A nucleoside with a phosphate attached at the 5' position is called a mononucleotide. A nucleoside with two or three phosphates attached is called a nucleotide diphosphate or nucleotide triphosphate, respectively.\nFigure  14.2.1\n : Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.\nThe nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages. The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have a single six-membered ring structure. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is read as “one prime”). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond.\n\nIn the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction (Figure  14.2.2\n ). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Unfortunately, by then Franklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\nThe photo in part A shows James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty. The x-ray diffraction pattern in part b is symmetrical, with dots in an x-shape\nFigure  14.2.2\n : The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present day understanding of DNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which helped to elucidate its double helix structure. (credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of Science)\nWatson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nAustrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found that the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is also known as Chargaff’s rules. This finding proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix model.\\n\\nSummary\\nDNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich Miescher, who called it nuclein because it was isolated from nuclei. Frederick Griffith's experiments with strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae provided the first hint that DNA may be the transforming principle. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria. Later experiments by Hershey and Chase using bacteriophage T2 proved that DNA is the genetic material. Chargaff found that the ratio of A = T and C = G, and that the percentage content of A, T, G, and C is different for different species.\\n\\n14.2: DNA Structure and Sequencing\\n\\nThe building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group. The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\\n\\nhe building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (Figure  14.2.1\\n ). The nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A) and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\\n\\nIllustration depicts the structure of a nucleoside, which is made up of a pentose with a nitrogenous base attached at the 1' position. There are two kinds of nitrogenous bases: pyrimidines, which have one six-membered ring, and purines, which have a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines, and adenine and guanine are purines. A nucleoside with a phosphate attached at the 5' position is called a mononucleotide. A nucleoside with two or three phosphates attached is called a nucleotide diphosphate or nucleotide triphosphate, respectively.\\nFigure  14.2.1\\n : Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.\\nThe nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages. The purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have a single six-membered ring structure. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is read as “one prime”). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-ray diffraction (Figure  14.2.2\\n ). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Unfortunately, by then Franklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.\\n\\nThe photo in part A shows James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty. The x-ray diffraction pattern in part b is symmetrical, with dots in an x-shape\\nFigure  14.2.2\\n : The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present day understanding of DNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which helped to elucidate its double helix structure. (credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of Science)\\nWatson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs with C. Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Erwin Chargaff\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Austrian biochemist who examined the content of DNA in different species and found Chargaff's rules.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Austria\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Country where Erwin Chargaff is from.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"British biologists who proposed the DNA double helix model.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Friedrich Miescher\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Swiss physician who first isolated DNA from white blood cells.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Griffith\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"British biologist who provided the first hint that DNA may be the transforming principle.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Scientists who proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Hershey and Chase\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Scientists who proved that DNA is the genetic material using bacteriophage T2.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"University of Cambridge\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Institution where Watson and Crick worked to determine the structure of DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Rosalind Franklin\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"British biophysicist and X-ray crystallographer who contributed to the understanding of DNA structure.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Linus Pauling\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"American chemist who discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Maurice Wilkins\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"British biophysicist who worked on the structure of DNA and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Erwin Chargaff\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Chargaff's rules are related to the composition of DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick proposed the double helix model of DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Friedrich Miescher\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Miescher first isolated DNA from white blood cells.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Griffith\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Griffith's experiments provided the first hint that DNA may be the transforming principle.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"They proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Hershey and Chase\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"They proved that DNA is the genetic material using bacteriophage T2.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Rosalind Franklin\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick\\\"<|>\\\"Franklin's data contributed to Watson and Crick's understanding of DNA structure.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"University of Cambridge\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick worked at the University of Cambridge.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Linus Pauling\\\"<|>\\\"Rosalind Franklin\\\"<|>\\\"Pauling's work on protein structure was related to Franklin's work on DNA structure.\\\")##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"DNA structure, biochemistry, genetics, scientific discovery, Nobel Prize\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand faces the 5' end of the other strand. The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm. Therefore, ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix. The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout. Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter. The twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves (Figure  14.2.3\n ).\n\nPart A shows an illustration of a DNA double helix, which has a sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside and nitrogenous base pairs on the inside. Part B shows base pairing between thymine and adenine, which form two hydrogen bonds, and between guanine and cytosine, which form three hydrogen bonds. Part C shows a molecular model of the DNA double helix. The outside of the helix alternates between wide gaps, called major grooves, and narrow gaps, called minor grooves.\nFigure  14.2.3\n : DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) phosphodiester bonds. The (c) major and minor grooves are binding sites for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and replication.\nDNA Sequencing Techniques\nUntil the 1990s, the sequencing of DNA (reading the sequence of DNA) was a relatively expensive and long process. Using radiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns. With currently available technology and automated machines, the process is cheap, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. Fred Sanger developed the sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today (Figure  14.2.4\n ).\n\nThe method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. The sequencing method is based on the use of chain terminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The dideoxynucleotides, or ddNTPSs, differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' OH group on the five-carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain is not extended any further because the free 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.\n\nPart A shows a template DNA strand and newly synthesized strands that were generated in the presence of dideoxynucleotides that terminate the chain at different points to generate fragments of different sizes. Each dideoxynucleotide is labeled a different color. Part B shows a sequence readout that was generated after the DNA fragments were separated on the basis of size. The color of the fragment indicates the identity of the nucleotide at the end of a given fragment. By reading the colors in order, the DNA sequence can be determined.\nFigure 14.2.4\n: In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to generate DNA fragments that terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis on the basis of size, and from the order of fragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram that is generated by a laser scanner.\nThe DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures. The DNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) are added. In addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a difference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980.\nGel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose. Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according\n######################\nOutput:"

If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain is not extended any further because the free 3' OH group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.\\n\\nPart A shows a template DNA strand and newly synthesized strands that were generated in the presence of dideoxynucleotides that terminate the chain at different points to generate fragments of different sizes. Each dideoxynucleotide is labeled a different color. Part B shows a sequence readout that was generated after the DNA fragments were separated on the basis of size. The color of the fragment indicates the identity of the nucleotide at the end of a given fragment. By reading the colors in order, the DNA sequence can be determined.\\nFigure 14.2.4\\n: In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method, dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides are used to generate DNA fragments that terminate at different points. The DNA is separated by capillary electrophoresis on the basis of size, and from the order of fragments formed, the DNA sequence can be read. The DNA sequence readout is shown on an electropherogram that is generated by a laser scanner.\\nThe DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures. The DNA is divided into four tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) are added. In addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube respectively. The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For detection purposes, each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a difference in length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser scanner. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980.\\nGel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose. Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger is a scientist who developed the dideoxy chain termination method for DNA sequencing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Double Helix\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The DNA double helix is a structure composed of two strands of DNA that are twisted together.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Sequencing Project\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Human Genome Sequencing Project is a research effort that sequenced the human DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"National Institutes of Health\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The National Institutes of Health is a organization that funded the human genome sequencing project.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cambridge University\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Cambridge University is a university where Frederick Sanger worked on DNA sequencing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Double Helix\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger developed a method for sequencing the DNA double helix.\\\"<|>\\\"scientific contribution, DNA sequencing\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Sequencing Project\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger's method was used in the Human Genome Sequencing Project.\\\"<|>\\\"research collaboration, genome sequencing\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"National Institutes of Health\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Sequencing Project\\\"<|>\\\"The National Institutes of Health funded the Human Genome Sequencing Project.\\\"<|>\\\"funding, research support\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cambridge University\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"Frederick Sanger worked on DNA sequencing at Cambridge University.\\\"<|>\\\"academic affiliation, research institution\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"DNA sequencing, double helix, genome sequencing, scientific research\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it (Figure 14.2.5\n).\n\nPhoto shows an agarose gel illuminated under UV light. The gel is nine lanes across. Each lane was loaded with a sample containing DNA fragments of differing size that have separated as they travel through the gel, from top to bottom. The DNA appears as thin, white bands on a black background. Lanes one and nine contain many bands from a DNA standard. These bands are closely spaced toward the top, and spaced farther apart further down the gel. Lanes two through eight contain one or two bands each. Some of these bands are identical in size and run the same distance into the gel. Others run a slightly different distance, indicating a small difference in size.\nFigure 14.2.5\n: DNA can be separated on the basis of size using gel electrophoresis. (credit: James Jacob, Tompkins Cortland Community College)\nEvolution Connection: Neanderthal Genome - How Are We Related?\n\nThe first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published by Richard E. Green et al. in 2010.1 Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago. Green’s team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world. Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination. In their study, the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the sequences, the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa. While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view. Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences. Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in Europe and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papua New Guineans.\n\nSeveral genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-day humans. These genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development. One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2, which is different in modern day humans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.\n\nDNA Packaging in Cells\nWhen comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features (Figure  14.2.6\n ). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.\n\nIllustration shows a eukaryotic cell, which has a membrane-bound nucleus containing chromatin and a nucleolus, and a prokaryotic cell, which has DNA contained in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The prokaryotic cell is much smaller than the eukaryotic cell.\nFigure  14.2.6\n : A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.\nExercise  14.2.1\n \n\nIn eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic cells, both processes occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages might there be to having them occur together?\n\nAnswer\nThe size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, E.coli, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\n\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nis a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose. Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it (Figure 14.2.5\\n).\\n\\nPhoto shows an agarose gel illuminated under UV light. The gel is nine lanes across. Each lane was loaded with a sample containing DNA fragments of differing size that have separated as they travel through the gel, from top to bottom. The DNA appears as thin, white bands on a black background. Lanes one and nine contain many bands from a DNA standard. These bands are closely spaced toward the top, and spaced farther apart further down the gel. Lanes two through eight contain one or two bands each. Some of these bands are identical in size and run the same distance into the gel. Others run a slightly different distance, indicating a small difference in size.\\nFigure 14.2.5\\n: DNA can be separated on the basis of size using gel electrophoresis.

Green et al. in 2010.1 Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago. Green’s team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world. Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination. In their study, the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the sequences, the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa. While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view. Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences. Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in Europe and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papua New Guineans.\\n\\nSeveral genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-day humans. These genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development. One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2, which is different in modern day humans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body.\\n\\nDNA Packaging in Cells\\nWhen comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features (Figure  14.2.6\\n ). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.\\n\\nIllustration shows a eukaryotic cell, which has a membrane-bound nucleus containing chromatin and a nucleolus, and a prokaryotic cell, which has DNA contained in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The prokaryotic cell is much smaller than the eukaryotic cell.\\nFigure  14.2.6\\n : A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.\\nExercise  14.2.1\\n \\n\\nIn eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic cells, both processes occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the processes? What advantages might there be to having them occur together?\\n\\nAnswer\\nThe size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, E.coli, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\\n\\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Agarose Gel Electrophoresis\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Agarose gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Fragments\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA fragments are separated based on size using agarose gel electrophoresis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Neanderthal Genome\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Neanderthal genome was sequenced to study human evolution and relationships.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Richard E.

Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\n\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus (Figure  14.2.7\n ). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer. The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure. This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.\n\nIn interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.\n\nIllustration shows the levels of organization of eukaryotic chromosomes, starting with the DNA double helix, which wraps around histone proteins. The entire DNA molecule wraps around many clusters of histone proteins, forming a structure that looks like beads on a string. The chromatin is further condensed by wrapping around a protein core. The result is a compact chromosome, shown in duplicated form.\nFigure  14.2.7\n : These figures illustrate the compaction of the eukaryotic chromosome.\nSummary\nThe currently accepted model of the double-helix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick. Some of the salient features are that the two strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel in nature. Deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the structure, and the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. The diameter of the double helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. A purine always pairs with a pyrimidine; A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. One turn of the helix has ten base pairs. During cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of the DNA by a process known as DNA replication. Prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome. In general, eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear DNA molecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different states of packaging and compaction.\n\n14.3: Basics of DNA Replication\n\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested: conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\n\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (Figure  14.3.1\n ): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\n\nIllustration shows the conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive models of DNA synthesis. In the conservative model, when DNA is replicated and both newly synthesized strands are paired together. In the semi-conservative model, each newly synthesized strand pairs with a parent strand. In the dispersive model, newly synthesized DNA is interspersed with parent DNA within both DNA strands.\nFigure  14.3.1\n : The three suggested models of DNA replication. Grey indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA\nIn conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. In the dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.\n\nMeselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the DNA (Figure  14.3.2\n ).\n\nIllustration shows an experiment in which E. coli was grown initially in media containing ^{15}N nucleotides. When the DNA was extracted and run in an ultracentrifuge, a band of DNA appeared low in the tube. The culture was next placed in ^{14}N medium.\n######################\nOutput:"

The result is a compact chromosome, shown in duplicated form.\\nFigure  14.2.7\\n : These figures illustrate the compaction of the eukaryotic chromosome.\\nSummary\\nThe currently accepted model of the double-helix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick. Some of the salient features are that the two strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel in nature. Deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the structure, and the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. The diameter of the double helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. A purine always pairs with a pyrimidine; A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. One turn of the helix has ten base pairs. During cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of the DNA by a process known as DNA replication. Prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome. In general, eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear DNA molecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different states of packaging and compaction.\\n\\n14.3: Basics of DNA Replication\\n\\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested: conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\\n\\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (Figure  14.3.1\\n ): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\\n\\nIllustration shows the conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive models of DNA synthesis. In the conservative model, when DNA is replicated and both newly synthesized strands are paired together. In the semi-conservative model, each newly synthesized strand pairs with a parent strand. In the dispersive model, newly synthesized DNA is interspersed with parent DNA within both DNA strands.\\nFigure  14.3.1\\n : The three suggested models of DNA replication. Grey indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA\\nIn conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. In the dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.\\n\\nMeselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the DNA (Figure  14.3.2\\n ).\\n\\nIllustration shows an experiment in which E. coli was grown initially in media containing ^{15}N nucleotides. When the DNA was extracted and run in an ultracentrifuge, a band of DNA appeared low in the tube. The culture was next placed in ^{14}N medium.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output in the required format:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA is a molecule that contains genetic information and is composed of two complementary strands.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Histones\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form nucleosomes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleosomes\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleosomes are structures formed by DNA wrapping around histone proteins.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick are scientists who proposed the double-helix structure of DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotes\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotes are organisms whose chromosomes consist of linear DNA molecules.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotes\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotes are organisms whose chromosomes consist of circular DNA molecules.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl are scientists who studied DNA replication.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a type of bacterium used in research, including DNA replication studies.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nitrogenous bases\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Nitrogenous bases are components of DNA that pair with each other to form the double helix.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Watson and Crick proposed the double-helix structure of DNA.\\\"<|>\\\"scientific discovery, DNA structure\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Histones\\\"<|>\\\"DNA wraps around histone proteins to form nucleosomes.\\\"<|>\\\"DNA-protein interaction, chromatin structure\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotes\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleosomes\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic chromosomes consist of linear DNA molecules packaged into nucleosomes.\\\"<|>\\\"chromatin structure, eukaryotic chromosomes\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl used E. coli to study DNA replication.\\\"<|>\\\"scientific research, DNA replication\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"DNA structure, chromatin, eukaryotic chromosomes, DNA replication, prokaryotes\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

When the DNA was extracted and run in an ultracentrifuge, a band of DNA appeared low in the tube. The culture was next placed in ^{14}N medium. After one generation, all of the DNA appeared in the middle of the tube, indicating that the DNA was a mixture of half ^{14}N and half ^{15}N DNA. After two generations, half of the DNA appeared in the middle of the tube, and half appeared higher up, indicating that half the DNA contained 50% ^{15}N, and half contained ^{14}N only. In subsequent generations, more and more of the DNA appeared in the upper, ^{14}N band.\nFigure  14.3.2\n : Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (red band) is heavier than DNA grown in 14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride solution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA grown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N, after one round of cell division the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N levels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent 14N. In subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only. This data supports the semi-conservative replication model. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nThe E. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14N and spun again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in 15N will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N after they had been shifted from 15N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N and 14N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.\n\nDuring DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. When two daughter DNA copies are formed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.\n\nSummary\nThe model for DNA replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. In conservative replication, the parental DNA is conserved, and the daughter DNA is newly synthesized. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and \n\n14.4: DNA Replication in Prokaryotes\n\nDNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions. This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is rapid and occurs without many mistakes.\n\nDNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available.

The process is quite rapid and occurs without many mistakes.\n\nDNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the process. One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one by one to the growing DNA chain that are complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy is obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them, similar to ATP which has three phosphate groups attached. When the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known: DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the\n######################\nOutput:"

).\\n\\nIllustration shows an experiment in which E. coli was grown initially in media containing ^{15}N nucleotides. When the DNA was extracted and run in an ultracentrifuge, a band of DNA appeared low in the tube. The culture was next placed in ^{14}N medium. After one generation, all of the DNA appeared in the middle of the tube, indicating that the DNA was a mixture of half ^{14}N and half ^{15}N DNA. After two generations, half of the DNA appeared in the middle of the tube, and half appeared higher up, indicating that half the DNA contained 50% ^{15}N, and half contained ^{14}N only. In subsequent generations, more and more of the DNA appeared in the upper, ^{14}N band.\\nFigure  14.3.2\\n : Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (red band) is heavier than DNA grown in 14N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride solution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA grown in 15N is switched to media containing 14N, after one round of cell division the DNA sediments halfway between the 15N and 14N levels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent 14N. In subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains 14N only. This data supports the semi-conservative replication model. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\\nThe E. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14N and spun again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in 15N will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N after they had been shifted from 15N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N and 14N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.\\n\\nDuring DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. When two daughter DNA copies are formed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.\\n\\nSummary\\nThe model for DNA replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. In conservative replication, the parental DNA is conserved, and the daughter DNA is newly synthesized. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands acts as template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and \\n\\n14.4: DNA Replication in Prokaryotes\\n\\nDNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions. This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is rapid and occurs without many mistakes.\\n\\nDNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available.

This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is quite rapid and occurs without many mistakes.\\n\\nDNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the process. One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides one by one to the growing DNA chain that are complementary to the template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy is obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them, similar to ATP which has three phosphate groups attached. When the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known: DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl are researchers who experimented with E. coli to study DNA replication.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a type of bacteria used in the experiment to study DNA replication.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Marconi Ruiz Villareal\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Mariana Ruiz Villareal is a contributor to the work on DNA replication.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"cesium chloride\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Cesium chloride is a type of salt used in density gradient centrifugation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase is an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the growing DNA chain during DNA replication.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA is a molecule that contains genetic information and is replicated during cell division.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli to study DNA replication.\\\"<|>\\\"research, experimentation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli contains DNA that is replicated during cell division.\\\"<|>\\\"biological process, DNA replication\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl\\\"<|>\\\"DNA replication\\\"<|>\\\"Meselson and Stahl's experiment supports the semi-conservative replication model of DNA.\\\"<|>\\\"research, DNA replication model\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"cesium chloride\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Cesium chloride is used in density gradient centrifugation to separate DNA based on its density.\\\"<|>\\\"experimental technique, density gradient centrifugation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the growing DNA chain during DNA replication.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme function, DNA synthesis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"DNA replication, semi-conservative model, molecular biology, experimentation\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

When the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known: DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair.\n\nHow does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins. In E. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome (as do most prokaryotes), it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds. Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix. DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction). It also requires a free 3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide. This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available. Then how does it add the first nucleotide? The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end. Another enzyme, RNA primase, synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA. Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand (Figure  14.4.1\n ).\n\nIllustration shows the replication fork. Helicase unwinds the helix, and single-strand binding proteins prevent the helix from re-forming. Topoisomerase prevents the DNA from getting too tightly coiled ahead of the replication fork. DNA primase forms an RNA primer, and DNA polymerase extends the DNA strand from the RNA primer. DNA synthesis occurs only in the 5' to 3' direction. On the leading strand, DNA synthesis occurs continuously. On the lagging strand, DNA synthesis restarts many times as the helix unwinds, resulting in many short fragments called “Okazaki fragments.” DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together into a single DNA molecule.\nFigure  14.4.1\n : A replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication. The DNA tends to become more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase breaks and reforms DNA’s phosphate backbone ahead of the replication fork, thereby relieving the pressure that results from this supercoiling. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent the helix from re-forming. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize the daughter DNA strand. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments, joining the fragments into a single DNA molecule. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)\nExercise  14.4.1\n \n\nYou isolate a cell strain in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has occurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?\n\nAnswer\nDNA ligase, as this enzyme joins together Okazaki fragments.\n\nThe replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, which poses a slight problem at the replication fork. As we know, the DNA double helix is anti-parallel; that is, one strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. One strand, which is complementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.\n\nThe leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'.

The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.\n\nThe leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides. The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.\n\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division. The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows.\n\nDNA replication steps\n\nDNA unwinds at the origin of replication.\nHelicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.\nSingle-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.\nTopoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.\nPrimase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.\nDNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.\nElongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.\nRNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.\nGaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.\nThe gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.\nTable  14.4.1\n  summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.\n\nTable  14.4.1\n : Prokaryotic DNA Replication: Enzymes and Their Function\nEnzyme/protein\tSpecific Function\nDNA pol I\tExonuclease activity removes RNA primer and replaces with newly synthesized DNA\nDNA pol II\tRepair function\nDNA pol III\tMain enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction\nHelicase\tOpens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases\nLigase\tSeals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA strand\nPrimase\tSynthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication\nSliding Clamp\tHelps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added\nTopoisomerase\tHelps relieve the stress on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks and then resealing the DNA\nSingle-strand binding proteins (SSB)\tBinds to single-stranded DNA to avoid DNA rewinding back.\n\nSummary\nReplication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome called the origin of replication—the point at which the DNA opens up. Helicase opens up the DNA double helix, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA near the replication fork to keep the fork open. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with DNA ligase, which creates phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-OH of one end and the 5' phosphate of the other strand.\n\n14.5: DNA Replication in Eukaryotes\n\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication.\n\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication. In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.\n\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol α, pol β\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nwho first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.\\n\\nThe leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides. The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.\\n\\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division. The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows.\\n\\nDNA replication steps\\n\\nDNA unwinds at the origin of replication.\\nHelicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.\\nSingle-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.\\nTopoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.\\nPrimase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.\\nDNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.\\nElongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.\\nRNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.\\nGaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.\\nThe gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.\\nTable  14.4.1\\n  summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.\\n\\nTable  14.4.1\\n : Prokaryotic DNA Replication: Enzymes and Their Function\\nEnzyme/protein\\tSpecific Function\\nDNA pol I\\tExonuclease activity removes RNA primer and replaces with newly synthesized DNA\\nDNA pol II\\tRepair function\\nDNA pol III\\tMain enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction\\nHelicase\\tOpens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases\\nLigase\\tSeals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA strand\\nPrimase\\tSynthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication\\nSliding Clamp\\tHelps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added\\nTopoisomerase\\tHelps relieve the stress on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks and then resealing the DNA\\nSingle-strand binding proteins (SSB)\\tBinds to single-stranded DNA to avoid DNA rewinding back.\\n\\nSummary\\nReplication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome called the origin of replication—the point at which the DNA opens up. Helicase opens up the DNA double helix, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA near the replication fork to keep the fork open. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with DNA ligase, which creates phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-OH of one end and the 5' phosphate of the other strand.\\n\\n14.5: DNA Replication in Eukaryotes\\n\\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication.\\n\\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication. In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.\\n\\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied.

In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.\n\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol α, pol β, pol γ, pol δ, and pol ε.\n\nThe essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available as template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the DNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of replication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Other proteins are then recruited to start the replication process (Table  14.5.1\n ).\n\nA helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication origin as the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication fork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer, DNA pol can start synthesis. While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol δ, the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε. A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA. RNase H removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined together after the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the phosphodiester bond.\n\nTelomere replication\nUnlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.\n\nThe ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure  14.5.1\n ) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.\n\nTelomerase has an associated RNA that complements the 5' overhang at the end of the chromosome. The RNA template is used to synthesize the complementary strand. Telomerase then shifts, and the process is repeated. Next, primase and DNA polymerase synthesize the rest of the complementary strand.\nFigure  14.5.1\n : The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.\nTelomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. It is not active in adult somatic cells. For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure  14.5.2\n ) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2009.\n\nPhoto of Elizabeth Blackburn.\nFigure  14.5.2\n : Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, is the scientist who discovered how telomerase works. (credit: US Embassy Sweden)\nTelomerase and Aging\nCells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.\n\nIn 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in regenerative medicine.1 Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\n\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\naryotic replication. In yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to the origin of replication in E. coli.\\n\\nThe number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol α, pol β, pol γ, pol δ, and pol ε.\\n\\nThe essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available as template. Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The chromatin (the complex between DNA and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the DNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery. At the origin of replication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. Other proteins are then recruited to start the replication process (Table  14.5.1\\n ).\\n\\nA helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix. Replication forks are formed at each replication origin as the DNA unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication fork. These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer, DNA pol can start synthesis. While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol δ, the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε. A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA. RNase H removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined together after the replacement of the RNA primers with DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the phosphodiester bond.\\n\\nTelomere replication\\nUnlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.\\n\\nThe ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure  14.5.1\\n ) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.\\n\\nTelomerase has an associated RNA that complements the 5' overhang at the end of the chromosome. The RNA template is used to synthesize the complementary strand. Telomerase then shifts, and the process is repeated. Next, primase and DNA polymerase synthesize the rest of the complementary strand.\\nFigure  14.5.1\\n : The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.\\nTelomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. It is not active in adult somatic cells. For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure  14.5.2\\n ) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2009.\\n\\nPhoto of Elizabeth Blackburn.\\nFigure  14.5.2\\n : Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, is the scientist who discovered how telomerase works. (credit: US Embassy Sweden)\\nTelomerase and Aging\\nCells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.\\n\\nIn 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. This may have potential in regenerative medicine.1 Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\\n\\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells.

Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\n\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.\n\nTable  14.5.1\n : Difference between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Replication\nProperty\tProkaryotes\tEukaryotes\nOrigin of replication\tSingle\tMultiple\nRate of replication\t1000 nucleotides/s\t50 to 100 nucleotides/s\nDNA polymerase types\t5\t14\nTelomerase\tNot present\tPresent\nRNA primer removal\tDNA pol I\tRNase H\nStrand elongation\tDNA pol III\tPol δ, pol ε\nSliding clamp\tSliding clamp\tPCNA\nSummary\nReplication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication. The mechanism is quite similar to prokaryotes. A primer is required to initiate synthesis, which is then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds nucleotides one by one to the growing chain. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides; the DNA remains one continuous strand by linking the DNA fragments with DNA ligase. The ends of the chromosomes pose a problem as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected.\n\n14.6: DNA Repair\n\nDNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.\n\nDNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.\n\nMost of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added (Figure  14.6.1\n ). In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol III. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.\n\nIllustration shows DNA polymerase replicating a strand of DNA. The enzyme has accidentally inserted G opposite A, resulting in a bulge. The enzyme backs up to fix the error.\nFigure  14.6.1\n : Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.\nSome errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair (Figure  14.6.2\n ). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base. If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In E. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.\n\nThe top illustration shows a replicated DNA strand with G-T base mismatch. The bottom illustration shows the repaired DNA, which has the correct G-C base pairing.\nFigure  14.6.2\n : In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.\nIn another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure  14.6.3\n ). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides\n######################\nOutput:"

Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans.\\n\\nCancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division.\\n\\nTable  14.5.1\\n : Difference between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Replication\\nProperty\\tProkaryotes\\tEukaryotes\\nOrigin of replication\\tSingle\\tMultiple\\nRate of replication\\t1000 nucleotides/s\\t50 to 100 nucleotides/s\\nDNA polymerase types\\t5\\t14\\nTelomerase\\tNot present\\tPresent\\nRNA primer removal\\tDNA pol I\\tRNase H\\nStrand elongation\\tDNA pol III\\tPol δ, pol ε\\nSliding clamp\\tSliding clamp\\tPCNA\\nSummary\\nReplication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication. The mechanism is quite similar to prokaryotes. A primer is required to initiate synthesis, which is then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds nucleotides one by one to the growing chain. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides; the DNA remains one continuous strand by linking the DNA fragments with DNA ligase. The ends of the chromosomes pose a problem as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected.\\n\\n14.6: DNA Repair\\n\\nDNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.\\n\\nDNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.\\n\\nMost of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added (Figure  14.6.1\\n ). In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol III. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.\\n\\nIllustration shows DNA polymerase replicating a strand of DNA. The enzyme has accidentally inserted G opposite A, resulting in a bulge. The enzyme backs up to fix the error.\\nFigure  14.6.1\\n : Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.\\nSome errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair (Figure  14.6.2\\n ). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base. If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In E. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.\\n\\nThe top illustration shows a replicated DNA strand with G-T base mismatch. The bottom illustration shows the repaired DNA, which has the correct G-C base pairing.\\nFigure  14.6.2\\n : In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.\\nIn another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure  14.6.3\\n ). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Telomerase\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Telomerase is an enzyme that helps maintain telomere length and is active in cancer cells.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer Cells\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer cells are abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably, accumulate mutations, and have shortened telomeres.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase is an enzyme responsible for DNA replication and proofreading.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Telomeres\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Telomeres are the protective ends of chromosomes, shortened in cancer cells, and extended by telomerase.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Age-related Diseases\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Age-related diseases are a group of disorders affected by telomere length and potentially treatable by telomere reactivation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Scientists\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Scientists are researchers who study telomere biology and cancer.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Humans\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Humans are the species being studied for telomere biology and cancer research.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mice\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Mice are used as a model organism in studies on telomere biology and age-related diseases.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Telomerase\\\"<|>\\\"Telomeres\\\"<|>\\\"Telomerase extends telomere length, promoting cellular health and potentially treating age-related diseases.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme function, telomere maintenance\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer Cells\\\"<|>\\\"Telomeres\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer cells have shortened telomeres, which can be extended by telomerase, potentially stopping their uncontrolled division.\\\"<|>\\\"cell biology, cancer development\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Telomeres\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase helps maintain telomere length through proofreading and replication.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme function, telomere maintenance\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Scientists\\\"<|>\\\"Telomere Reactivation\\\"<|>\\\"Scientists study telomere reactivation as a potential treatment for age-related diseases.\\\"<|>\\\"research, disease treatment\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"telomere biology, cancer research, DNA replication, enzyme function, age-related diseases\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.\nIn another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure  14.6.3\n ). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.\n\nIllustration shows a DNA strand in which a thymine dimer has formed. Excision repair enzymes cut out the section of DNA that contains the dimer so it can be replaced with normal base pairs.\nFigure  14.6.3\n : Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other can form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.\nA well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure  14.6.4\n ). Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication. People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who dont have the condition.\n\nPhoto shows a person with mottled skin lesions that result from xeroderma pigmentosa.\nFigure  14.6.4\n : Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV is not repaired. Exposure to sunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)\nErrors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body.\n\nMutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure  14.6.5\n .\n\nIllustration shows different types of point mutations that result from a single amino acid substitution. In a silent mutation, no change in the amino acid sequence occurs. In a missense mutation, one amino acid is substituted for another. In a nonsense mutation, a stop codon is substituted for an amino acid. In a frameshift mutation, one or more bases is added or deleted, resulting in a change in the reading frame.\nFigure  14.6.5\n : Mutations can lead to changes in the protein sequence encoded by the DNA.\nExercise  14.6.1\n \n\nA frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a mutation that results in the insertion of one nucleotide. Why?\n\nAnswer\nIf three nucleotides are added, one additional amino acid will be incorporated into the protein chain, but the reading frame won't shift.\n\nMutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa.\n\nSummary\nDNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base. In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is\n######################\nOutput:"

The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.\\nIn another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure  14.6.3\\n ). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.\\n\\nIllustration shows a DNA strand in which a thymine dimer has formed. Excision repair enzymes cut out the section of DNA that contains the dimer so it can be replaced with normal base pairs.\\nFigure  14.6.3\\n : Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other can form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.\\nA well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure  14.6.4\\n ). Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication. People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who dont have the condition.\\n\\nPhoto shows a person with mottled skin lesions that result from xeroderma pigmentosa.\\nFigure  14.6.4\\n : Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV is not repaired. Exposure to sunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)\\nErrors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body.\\n\\nMutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure  14.6.5\\n .\\n\\nIllustration shows different types of point mutations that result from a single amino acid substitution. In a silent mutation, no change in the amino acid sequence occurs. In a missense mutation, one amino acid is substituted for another. In a nonsense mutation, a stop codon is substituted for an amino acid. In a frameshift mutation, one or more bases is added or deleted, resulting in a change in the reading frame.\\nFigure  14.6.5\\n : Mutations can lead to changes in the protein sequence encoded by the DNA.\\nExercise  14.6.1\\n \\n\\nA frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a mutation that results in the insertion of one nucleotide. Why?\\n\\nAnswer\\nIf three nucleotides are added, one additional amino acid will be incorporated into the protein chain, but the reading frame won't shift.\\n\\nMutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa.\\n\\nSummary\\nDNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base. In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase is an enzyme responsible for DNA replication and editing, able to correct mistakes through proofreading.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mismatch Repair Enzymes\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mismatch repair enzymes recognize and correct mismatched bases in DNA replication.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleotide Excision Repair Enzymes\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleotide excision repair enzymes correct DNA damage caused by UV exposure, such as thymine dimers.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Xeroderma Pigmentosa\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Xeroderma pigmentosa is a genetic disorder characterized by high sensitivity to UV rays and inability to repair DNA damage.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"James Halpern\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"James Halpern is a researcher who contributed to the study of xeroderma pigmentosa.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Thymine Dimers\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Thymine dimers are a type of DNA damage caused by UV exposure, leading to distortion of the DNA double helix.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Ligase\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DNA ligase is an enzyme that seals gaps in DNA replication by forming phosphodiester linkages.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Pol.\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Pol is an enzyme involved in nucleotide excision repair, responsible for filling gaps with correctly paired nucleotides.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Mismatches\\\"<|>\\\"DNA polymerase corrects mismatches during DNA replication through proofreading.\\\"<|>\\\"error correction, DNA replication\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mismatches\\\"<|>\\\"Mismatch Repair Enzymes\\\"<|>\\\"Mismatch repair enzymes recognize and correct mismatches in DNA replication.\\\"<|>\\\"error correction, DNA repair\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleotide Excision Repair Enzymes\\\"<|>\\\"Thymine Dimers\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleotide excision repair enzymes correct DNA damage caused by thymine dimers.\\\"<|>\\\"DNA repair, UV damage\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"James Halpern\\\"<|>\\\"Xeroderma Pigmentosa\\\"<|>\\\"James Halpern contributed to the study of xeroderma pigmentosa.\\\"<|>\\\"research collaboration, rare disease\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Xeroderma Pigmentosa\\\"<|>\\\"DNA Repair Defect\\\"<|>\\\"Xeroderma pigmentosa is caused by a defect in DNA repair mechanisms.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic disorder, DNA repair\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"DNA replication, DNA repair, mutations, genetic disorders, UV damage\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters.

Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (Figure  15.1.1\n ). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.\n\nStructures of the twenty amino acids are given. Six amino acids—glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine—are non-polar and aliphatic, meaning they do not have a ring. Six amino acids—serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, asparagine, and glutamate—are polar but uncharged. Three amino acids—lysine, arginine, and histidine—are positively charged. Two amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, are negatively charged. Three amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—are nonpolar and aromatic.\nFigure  15.1.1\n : Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino group ( NH+3\n ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue).

It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base. In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is removed along with a few bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase. The ends of the newly synthesized fragment are attached to the rest of the DNA using DNA ligase, which creates a phosphodiester bond.\\n\\nMost mistakes are corrected, and if they are not, they may result in a mutation defined as a permanent change in the DNA sequence. Mutations can be of many types, such as substitution, deletion, insertion, and translocation. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences such as cancer. Mutations can be induced or may occur spontaneously.\\n\\n15: Genes and Proteins\\n\\nSince the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation.

In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell. Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it.\\n\\n15.0: Prelude to Genes and Proteins\\n\\nSince the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation.

Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product.

Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (Figure  15.1.1\\n ). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.\\n\\nStructures of the twenty amino acids are given. Six amino acids—glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine—are non-polar and aliphatic, meaning they do not have a ring. Six amino acids—serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, asparagine, and glutamate—are polar but uncharged. Three amino acids—lysine, arginine, and histidine—are positively charged. Two amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, are negatively charged. Three amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—are nonpolar and aromatic.\\nFigure  15.1.1\\n : Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown.

Three amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—are nonpolar and aromatic.\nFigure  15.1.1\n : Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino group ( NH+3\n ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged, as well as large or small. It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein structure and function.\nThe Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein\nThe flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma (Figure  15.1.2\n ), which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.\n\nTo make a protein, genetic information encoded by the DNA must be transcribed onto an mRNA molecule. The RNA is then processed by splicing to remove exons and by the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. A ribosome then reads the sequence on the mRNA, and uses this information to string amino acids into a protein.\nFigure  15.1.2\n : Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA. Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein.\nThe Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal\nGiven the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called codons. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (Figure  15.1.4\n ). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.\n\nScientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified (Figure  15.1.3\n ).\n\nFigure shows all 64 codons. Sixty-two of these code for amino acids, and three are stop codons.\nFigure  15.1.3\n : This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in a nascent protein. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nIn addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.\n\nThe genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.\n\nIllustration shows a frameshift mutation in which the reading frame is altered by the deletion of two amino acids.\nFigure  15.1.4\n : The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.\nDegeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\n. Three amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—are nonpolar and aromatic.\\nFigure  15.1.1\\n : Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino group ( NH+3\\n ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged, as well as large or small. It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein structure and function.\\nThe Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein\\nThe flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma (Figure  15.1.2\\n ), which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.\\n\\nTo make a protein, genetic information encoded by the DNA must be transcribed onto an mRNA molecule. The RNA is then processed by splicing to remove exons and by the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. A ribosome then reads the sequence on the mRNA, and uses this information to string amino acids into a protein.\\nFigure  15.1.2\\n : Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA. Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein.\\nThe Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal\\nGiven the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called codons. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (Figure  15.1.4\\n ). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.\\n\\nScientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified (Figure  15.1.3\\n ).\\n\\nFigure shows all 64 codons. Sixty-two of these code for amino acids, and three are stop codons.\\nFigure  15.1.3\\n : This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in a nascent protein. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\\nIn addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.\\n\\nThe genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.\\n\\nIllustration shows a frameshift mutation in which the reading frame is altered by the deletion of two amino acids.\\nFigure  15.1.4\\n : The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.\\nDegeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all known living organisms.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"proteins\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Proteins are biomolecules that are composed of amino acids and perform a wide range of functions in the cell.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"amino acids\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are composed of an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Francis Crick\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Francis Crick is a scientist who contributed to the discovery of the structure of DNA and the genetic code.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Sydney Brenner\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Sydney Brenner is a scientist who contributed to the discovery of the genetic code.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Central Dogma\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Central Dogma is a concept in molecular biology that describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA (messenger RNA)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA is a molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into protein.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A ribosome is a complex molecular machine that reads mRNA and translates it into protein.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"codons\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Codons are sequences of three nucleotides in mRNA that specify one of the 20 amino acids or a stop signal during protein synthesis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"genetic code\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The genetic code is the set of rules that dictates how the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids in proteins.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which carries the genetic information to the ribosome for protein synthesis.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic information transfer, transcription\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA is translated into protein by the ribosome, which reads the sequence of nucleotides and specifies the sequence of amino acids.\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, translation\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Francis Crick\\\"<|>\\\"genetic code\\\"<|>\\\"Francis Crick contributed to the discovery of the genetic code, which is the set of rules that dictates how mRNA is translated into protein.\\\"<|>\\\"scientific contribution, genetic code discovery\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Sydney Brenner\\\"<|>\\\"genetic code\\\"<|>\\\"Sydney Brenner contributed to the discovery of the genetic code, which is the set of rules that dictates how mRNA is translated into protein.\\\"<|>\\\"scientific contribution, genetic code discovery\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Central Dogma\\\"<|>\\\"genetic code\\\"<|>\\\"The Central Dogma is the concept that describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins, which is dictated by the genetic code.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic information flow, molecular biology concept\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"molecular biology, genetics, protein synthesis, central dogma, genetic code\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

(credit “kiwi”: \"Kelbv\"/Flickr; credit: “strawberry”: Alisdair McDiarmid)\nQuestion: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure  15.1.5\n ) also have approximately the same amount of DNA?\n\nBackground: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell nuclei. Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.\n\nHypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?\n\nTest your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit.\n\nPrepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt. Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).\nGrind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt instrument. Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.\nAdd 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.\nRemove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container.\nPour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. You should observe white, precipitated DNA.\nGather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.\nRecord your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit.\n\nAnalyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your results reproducible?\n\nDraw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? If you had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?\n\nSummary\nThe genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.\n\n15.2: Prokaryotic Transcription\n\nThe prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid. Prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids that are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes.\n\nThe prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nreading frame is altered by the deletion of two amino acids.\\nFigure  15.1.4\\n : The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.\\nDegeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional.\\n\\nScientific Method Connection: Which Has More DNA: A Kiwi or a Strawberry?\\n\\nPhotographs show a thin slice of a green kiwi fruit and a bowl of strawberries.\\nFigure  15.1.5\\n : Do you think that a kiwi or a strawberry has more DNA per fruit? (credit “kiwi”: \\\"Kelbv\\\"/Flickr; credit: “strawberry”: Alisdair McDiarmid)\\nQuestion: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure  15.1.5\\n ) also have approximately the same amount of DNA?\\n\\nBackground: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell nuclei. Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.\\n\\nHypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?\\n\\nTest your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit.\\n\\nPrepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt. Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).\\nGrind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt instrument. Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.\\nAdd 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.\\nRemove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container.\\nPour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. You should observe white, precipitated DNA.\\nGather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.\\nRecord your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit.\\n\\nAnalyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your results reproducible?\\n\\nDraw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? If you had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?\\n\\nSummary\\nThe genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.\\n\\n15.2: Prokaryotic Transcription\\n\\nThe prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid. Prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids that are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes.\\n\\nThe prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles.

In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes.

In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.\n\nTranscription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand. The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in A–T pairing in a DNA double helix.\n\nThe nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “+” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides.\n\nInitiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes\nProkaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.\n\nOur discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial species. Although some differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of E. coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.\n\nProkaryotic RNA Polymerase\nProkaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α, α, β, and β' comprise the polymerase core enzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two α-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the β-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” mRNA molecule; and the β' binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, σ, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without σ, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme.\n\nProkaryotic Promoters\nA promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure  15.2.1\n ). The -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence, TTGACA, is recognized and bound by σ. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.\n\nIllustration shows the σ subunit of RNA polymerase bound to two consensus sequences that are 10 and 35 bases upstream of the transcription start site. RNA polymerase is bound to σ.\nFigure  15.2.1\n : The σ subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight. The σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.\n\nlongation and Termination in Prokaryotes\nThe transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the σ subunit from the polymerase. The dissociation of σ allows the core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (Figure  15.2.2\n ). The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.\n\nIllustration shows RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase. The RNA strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\nFigure  15.2.\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\ncell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.\\n\\nTranscription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand. The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in A–T pairing in a DNA double helix.\\n\\nThe nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream. Conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with “+” numbering and are called downstream nucleotides.\\n\\nInitiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes\\nProkaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation can all occur simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify more than one protein.\\n\\nOur discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in Escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial species. Although some differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of E. coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species.\\n\\nProkaryotic RNA Polymerase\\nProkaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α, α, β, and β' comprise the polymerase core enzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two α-subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the β-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” mRNA molecule; and the β' binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, σ, is involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate initiation site. Without σ, the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish. The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme.\\n\\nProkaryotic Promoters\\nA promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure  15.2.1\\n ). The -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence, TTGACA, is recognized and bound by σ. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released.\\n\\nIllustration shows the σ subunit of RNA polymerase bound to two consensus sequences that are 10 and 35 bases upstream of the transcription start site. RNA polymerase is bound to σ.\\nFigure  15.2.1\\n : The σ subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight. The σ subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription has been initiated.\\n\\nlongation and Termination in Prokaryotes\\nThe transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the σ subunit from the polymerase. The dissociation of σ allows the core enzyme to proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it (Figure  15.2.2\\n ). The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.\\n\\nIllustration shows RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase. The RNA strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\\nFigure  15.2.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleoid\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The nucleoid is the region in a prokaryotic cell where DNA resides.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Plasmid\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Plasmids are circular DNA molecules that can carry genes for antibiotic resistance and can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli is a well-studied bacterial species used as an example to describe transcription in prokaryotes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase is an enzyme responsible for transcribing genes in prokaryotes, composed of five subunits.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"α-subunit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The α-subunit is a component of the RNA Polymerase core enzyme, necessary for assembling the polymerase on the DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"β-subunit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The β-subunit is a component of the RNA Polymerase core enzyme, binding to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent mRNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"β'-subunit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The β'-subunit is a component of the RNA Polymerase core enzyme, binding to the DNA template strand.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"σ-subunit\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The σ-subunit is a component of the RNA Polymerase holoenzyme, involved in transcription initiation and conferring transcriptional specificity.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Promoter\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A promoter is a DNA sequence where the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transcription Bubble\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The transcription bubble is the region of DNA unwinding during transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleoid\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"The nucleoid is where prokaryotic DNA resides.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular structure, DNA location\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli uses RNA Polymerase to transcribe its genes.\\\"<|>\\\"organism, transcription process\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Plasmid\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase transcribes genes from plasmids.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme function, gene expression\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"σ-subunit\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"The σ-subunit is part of the RNA Polymerase holoenzyme, involved in transcription initiation.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme subunit, transcription initiation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Promoter\\\"<|>\\\"Transcription Bubble\\\"<|>\\\"The promoter region influences the formation of the transcription bubble.\\\"<|>\\\"DNA sequence, transcription initiation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"transcription, prokaryotes, RNA Polymerase, gene expression, DNA\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.\n\nIllustration shows RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase. The RNA strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\nFigure  15.2.2\n : During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.\nProkaryotic Termination Signals\nOnce a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One is protein-based and the other is RNA-based. Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. The interaction with rho releases the mRNA from the transcription bubble.\n\nRho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C–G nucleotides. The mRNA folds back on itself, and the complementary C–G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A–T nucleotides. The complementary U–A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.\n\nUpon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell (Figure  15.2.3\n ). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.\n\nIllustration shows multiple mRNAs transcribed off one gene. Ribosomes attach to the mRNA before transcription is complete and begin to make protein.\nFigure  15.2.3\n : Multiple polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently translate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides. In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration in the bacterial cell.\n\nSummary\nIn prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template comprising two consensus sequences that recruit RNA polymerase. The prokaryotic polymerase consists of a core enzyme of four protein subunits and a σ protein that assists only with initiation. Elongation synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of 40 nucleotides per second. Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs either by rho protein interaction or by the formation of an mRNA hairpin.\n\n15.3: Eukaryotic Transcription\n\nProkaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated.\n\nProkaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each transcribe a different subset of genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.\n\nInitiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes\nUnlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate polymerase.\n\nThe Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\nThe features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.\n\nRNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table  15.3.1\n ). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein\n######################\nOutput:"

The base pairing between DNA and RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely.\\n\\nIllustration shows RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase. The RNA strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction.\\nFigure  15.2.2\\n : During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.\\nProkaryotic Termination Signals\\nOnce a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One is protein-based and the other is RNA-based. Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. The interaction with rho releases the mRNA from the transcription bubble.\\n\\nRho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C–G nucleotides. The mRNA folds back on itself, and the complementary C–G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A–T nucleotides. The complementary U–A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.\\n\\nUpon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently. The unification of transcription, translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell (Figure  15.2.3\\n ). In contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation.\\n\\nIllustration shows multiple mRNAs transcribed off one gene. Ribosomes attach to the mRNA before transcription is complete and begin to make protein.\\nFigure  15.2.3\\n : Multiple polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently translate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides. In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration in the bacterial cell.\\n\\nSummary\\nIn prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the DNA template comprising two consensus sequences that recruit RNA polymerase. The prokaryotic polymerase consists of a core enzyme of four protein subunits and a σ protein that assists only with initiation. Elongation synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of 40 nucleotides per second. Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs either by rho protein interaction or by the formation of an mRNA hairpin.\\n\\n15.3: Eukaryotic Transcription\\n\\nProkaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated.\\n\\nProkaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect its mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each transcribe a different subset of genes. Eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein.\\n\\nInitiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes\\nUnlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate polymerase.\\n\\nThe Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\\nThe features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.\\n\\nRNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table  15.3.1\\n ). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase is an enzyme that synthesizes mRNA from a DNA template.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic RNA polymerase is a type of RNA polymerase found in prokaryotic cells.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase is a type of RNA polymerase found in eukaryotic cells.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA template\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"DNA template is the region of DNA where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA is a type of RNA molecule synthesized during transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Rho protein\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Rho protein is a protein involved in rho-dependent termination of transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic cell\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic cell is a type of cell that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cell\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cell is a type of cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells where DNA is stored.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cytoplasm\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Cytoplasm is the region of a cell outside the nucleus where translation occurs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transcription factors\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Transcription factors are proteins that assist in the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter region.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"DNA template\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase binds to the DNA template to initiate transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme-substrate interaction, transcription initiation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic cell\\\"<|>\\\"Prokaryotic RNA polymerase is found in prokaryotic cells.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular component, protein localization\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cell\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase is found in eukaryotic cells.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular component, protein localization\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Rho protein\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Rho protein is involved in rho-dependent termination of transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-protein interaction, transcription termination\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase during transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"product-enzyme interaction, transcription\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Transcription factors\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase\\\"><|>\\\"Transcription factors assist in the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter region.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-protein interaction, transcription initiation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"transcription, RNA polymerase, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, mRNA, gene expression\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.\n\nRNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table  15.3.1\n ). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of translation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs except for the 5S rRNA molecule. The “S” designation applies to “Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle sediments during centrifugation.\n\nTable  15.3.1\n : Locations, Products, and Sensitivities of the Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\n\nRNA Polymerase\tCellular Compartment\tProduct of Transcription\tα-Amanitin Sensitivity\nI\tNucleolus\tAll rRNAs except 5S rRNA\tInsensitive\nII\tNucleus\tAll protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs\tExtremely sensitive\nIII\tNucleus\t5S rRNA, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs\tModerately sensitive\nRNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module’s discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.\n\nRNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre-RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs have a variety of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.\n\nA scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, α-amanitin (table above). Interestingly, α-amanitin produced by Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the three polymerases very differently. RNA polymerase I is completely insensitive to α-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this poison. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to α-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive. Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied. Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters.\n\nStructure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter\nEukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a TATA box. For example, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1) site (Figure  15.3.1\n ). For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is TATAAAA, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the nontemplate strand. This sequence is not identical to the E. coli TATA box, but it conserves the A–T rich element. The thermostability of A–T bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.\n\nIllustration shows a series of transcription factors binding to the promoter, which is upstream of the gene. After all of the transcription factors are bound, RNA polymerase binds as well.\nFigure  15.3.1\n : A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown. Transcription factors recognize the promoter. RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.\nArt Connection\n\nAn illustration shows that before RNA processing, there is a primary RNA transcript including five boxes labeled, left to right, as exon 1, intron, exon 2, intron, and exon 3. After RNA processing, there is a spliced RNA with these parts, left to right: a 5' cap, a 5' untranslated region, exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, a 3' untranslated region, and a poly-a tail.\nFigure  15.3.2\n : Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out. A 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are also added.\nA scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome. Would you expect the bacteria to transcribe the gene?\n\nThe mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (AT\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nup of 10 subunits or more. Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.\\n\\nRNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes (Table  15.3.1\\n ). The rRNA molecules are considered structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of translation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs except for the 5S rRNA molecule. The “S” designation applies to “Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle sediments during centrifugation.\\n\\nTable  15.3.1\\n : Locations, Products, and Sensitivities of the Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases\\n\\nRNA Polymerase\\tCellular Compartment\\tProduct of Transcription\\tα-Amanitin Sensitivity\\nI\\tNucleolus\\tAll rRNAs except 5S rRNA\\tInsensitive\\nII\\tNucleus\\tAll protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs\\tExtremely sensitive\\nIII\\tNucleus\\t5S rRNA, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs\\tModerately sensitive\\nRNA polymerase II is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this module’s discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.\\n\\nRNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre-RNAs. The tRNAs have a critical role in translation; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small nuclear RNAs have a variety of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs and regulating transcription factors.\\n\\nA scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, α-amanitin (table above). Interestingly, α-amanitin produced by Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the three polymerases very differently. RNA polymerase I is completely insensitive to α-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA in vitro in the presence of this poison. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is extremely sensitive to α-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately sensitive. Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied. Because RNA polymerase II transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters.\\n\\nStructure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter\\nEukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a TATA box. For example, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1) site (Figure  15.3.1\\n ). For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is TATAAAA, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the nontemplate strand. This sequence is not identical to the E. coli TATA box, but it conserves the A–T rich element. The thermostability of A–T bonds is low and this helps the DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.\\n\\nIllustration shows a series of transcription factors binding to the promoter, which is upstream of the gene. After all of the transcription factors are bound, RNA polymerase binds as well.\\nFigure  15.3.1\\n : A generalized promoter of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II is shown. Transcription factors recognize the promoter. RNA polymerase II then binds and forms the transcription initiation complex.\\nArt Connection\\n\\nAn illustration shows that before RNA processing, there is a primary RNA transcript including five boxes labeled, left to right, as exon 1, intron, exon 2, intron, and exon 3. After RNA processing, there is a spliced RNA with these parts, left to right: a 5' cap, a 5' untranslated region, exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, a 3' untranslated region, and a poly-a tail.\\nFigure  15.3.2\\n : Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be spliced out. A 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are also added.\\nA scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome. Would you expect the bacteria to transcribe the gene?\\n\\nThe mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (AT\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase I\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase I is an enzyme responsible for transcribing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in the nucleolus.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase II\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase II is an enzyme responsible for transcribing protein-coding nuclear pre-mRNAs in the nucleus.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase III\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase III is an enzyme responsible for transcribing structural RNAs, including 5S pre-rRNA, transfer pre-RNAs, and small nuclear pre-RNAs, in the nucleus.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleolus\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The nucleolus is a specialized nuclear substructure where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The nucleus is the cellular compartment where RNA polymerase II and III are located, synthesizing pre-mRNAs and structural RNAs, respectively.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"α-Amanitin\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"α-Amanitin is a mushroom poison that affects RNA polymerases I, II, and III differently, used to determine which polymerase transcribes a gene.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Amanita phalloides\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Amanita phalloides, also known as the Death Cap mushroom, produces α-amanitin.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mouse Thymidine Kinase Gene\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The mouse thymidine kinase gene is an example of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II, with a promoter containing a TATA box and other elements.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase I\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleolus\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, where it transcribes rRNA genes.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme location, cellular compartment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase II\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase II is located in the nucleus, where it transcribes pre-mRNAs.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme location, cellular compartment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase III\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase III is also located in the nucleus, transcribing structural RNAs.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme location, cellular compartment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"α-Amanitin\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase I\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase I is insensitive to α-amanitin, a mushroom poison.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme inhibitor, toxicity\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"α-Amanitin\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase II\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase II is extremely sensitive to α-amanitin.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme inhibitor, toxicity\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"α-Amanitin\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase III\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase III is moderately sensitive to α-amanitin.\\\"<|>\\\"enzyme inhibitor, toxicity\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"transcription, RNA polymerase, eukaryotic gene expression, gene regulation\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (ATTTGCAT). These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “active” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell.\n\nTranscription Factors for RNA Polymerase II\nThe complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters. An army of basal transcription factors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed. Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation.\n\nThe names of the basal transcription factors begin with “TFII” (this is the transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and are specified with the letters A–J. The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.\n\nThe processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of transcription factors, but the general theme is the same. Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.\n\nEvolution Connection: The Evolution of Promoters\n\nThe evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that gene’s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.\n\nScientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.\n\nIt is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher organisms. However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.1\n\nPromoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III\nIn eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.\n\nEukaryotic Elongation and Termination\nFollowing the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.\n\nAlthough the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA–histone complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight histones like thread around a spool.\n\nFor polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome. This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands for “facilitates chromatin transcription.” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.\n\nThe termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA\n######################\nOutput:"

These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.\\n\\nEukaryotic Elongation and Termination\\nFollowing the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.\\n\\nAlthough the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA–histone complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight histones like thread around a spool.\\n\\nFor polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome. This is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands for “facilitates chromatin transcription.” This complex pulls histones away from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.\\n\\nThe termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing.

Once the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.\n\nThe termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and III require termination signals. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a termination protein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.\n\nSummary\nTranscription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of polymerases, depending on the gene being transcribed. RNA polymerase II transcribes all of the protein-coding genes, whereas RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNA genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes rRNA, tRNA, and small nuclear RNA genes. The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes involves the binding of several transcription factors to complex promoter sequences that are usually located upstream of the gene being copied. The mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, and the FACT complex moves and reassembles nucleosomes as the polymerase passes by. Whereas RNA polymerases I and III terminate transcription by protein- or RNA hairpin-dependent methods, RNA polymerase II transcribes for 1,000 or more nucleotides beyond the gene template and cleaves the excess during pre-mRNA processing.\n\n15.4: RNA Processing in Eukaryotes\n\nAfter transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery.\n\nAfter transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery.\n\nmRNA Processing\nThe eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical E. coli mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.\n\nPre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the appropriate amino acids. In rare cases, the mRNA transcript can be “edited” after it is transcribed.\n\nEvolution Connection: RNA Editing in Trypanosomes\n\nThe trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in humans (Figure  15.4.1\n ). Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to The Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.\n\nMicrograph shows T. brucei, which has a u-shaped cell body and a long tail.\nFigure  15.4.1\n : Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)\nOther genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript. However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides to bind with. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the catalysts in RNA editing.\n\nRNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited. RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.\n######################\nOutput:"

Once the pre-mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes.\\n\\nThe termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and III require termination signals. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a termination protein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III involves an mRNA hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.\\n\\nSummary\\nTranscription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of polymerases, depending on the gene being transcribed. RNA polymerase II transcribes all of the protein-coding genes, whereas RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNA genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes rRNA, tRNA, and small nuclear RNA genes. The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes involves the binding of several transcription factors to complex promoter sequences that are usually located upstream of the gene being copied. The mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, and the FACT complex moves and reassembles nucleosomes as the polymerase passes by. Whereas RNA polymerases I and III terminate transcription by protein- or RNA hairpin-dependent methods, RNA polymerase II transcribes for 1,000 or more nucleotides beyond the gene template and cleaves the excess during pre-mRNA processing.\\n\\n15.4: RNA Processing in Eukaryotes\\n\\nAfter transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery.\\n\\nAfter transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery.\\n\\nmRNA Processing\\nThe eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical E. coli mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.\\n\\nPre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the appropriate amino acids. In rare cases, the mRNA transcript can be “edited” after it is transcribed.\\n\\nEvolution Connection: RNA Editing in Trypanosomes\\n\\nThe trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in humans (Figure  15.4.1\\n ). Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are organelles that express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote. The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to The Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell performs an additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.\\n\\nMicrograph shows T. brucei, which has a u-shaped cell body and a long tail.\\nFigure  15.4.1\\n : Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. The mRNAs of this pathogen must be modified by the addition of nucleotides before protein synthesis can occur. (credit: modification of work by Torsten Ochsenreiter)\\nOther genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript. However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has U nucleotides to bind with. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The 3' ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is, guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the catalysts in RNA editing.\\n\\nRNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited. RNA editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"FACT complex\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The FACT complex is a group of proteins involved in recreating nucleosomes during transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase II\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase II is an enzyme responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes in eukaryotes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase I\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase I is an enzyme responsible for transcribing rRNA genes in eukaryotes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase III\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase III is an enzyme responsible for transcribing rRNA, tRNA, and small nuclear RNA genes in eukaryotes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Trypanosoma brucei\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan pathogen that causes sleeping sickness in humans.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"mitochondria\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that supply energy and have their own DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a type of bacteria used as a model organism in scientific research.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"FACT complex\\\"<|>\\\"nucleosomes\\\"<|>\\\"The FACT complex is involved in recreating nucleosomes during transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"molecular interaction, transcription regulation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase II\\\"<|>\\\"protein-coding genes\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase II transcribes protein-coding genes in eukaryotes.\\\"<|>\\\"transcription, gene expression\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Trypanosoma brucei\\\"<|>\\\"sleeping sickness\\\"<|>\\\"Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans.\\\"<|>\\\"pathogen, disease causation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"mitochondria\\\"<|>\\\"RNA editing\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondrial pre-mRNAs undergo RNA editing to specify functional proteins.\\\"<|>\\\"RNA processing, mitochondrial gene expression\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"transcription, RNA processing, gene expression, mitochondria, RNA editing, protein synthesis\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

One possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions.\n\n5' Capping\nWhile the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage. This moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In addition, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.\n\n3' Poly-A Tail\nOnce elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-rich sequence, leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues, called the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm.\n\nPre-mRNA Splicing\nEukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are expressed), and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role), which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins.\n\nThe discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein sequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. The genes of higher eukaryotes very often contain one or more introns. These regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. It is possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes longer to transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns. Alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes throughout evolution. This is supported by the fact that separate exons often encode separate protein subunits or domains. For the most part, the sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately affecting the protein product.\n\nAll of a pre-mRNA’s introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional. The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing (Figure  15.4.2\n ). Introns are removed and degraded while the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus. Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns will be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. The splicing of pre-mRNAs is conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called spliceosomes.\n\nArt Connection\n\nIllustration shows a spliceosome bound to mRNA. An intron is wrapped around snRNPs associated with the spliceosome. When the splice is complete, the exons on either side of the intron are fused together, and the intron forms a ring structure.\nFigure  15.4.2\n : Pre-mRNA splicing involves the precise removal of introns from the primary RNA transcript. The splicing process is catalyzed by protein complexes called spliceosomes that are composed of proteins and RNA molecules called snRNAs. Spliceosomes recognize sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the intron.\nErrors in splicing are implicated in cancers and other human diseases. What kinds of mutations might lead to splicing errors? Think of different possible outcomes if splicing errors occur.\n\nNote that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to undergo the process of splicing—in addition to 5' capping and the addition of a poly-A tail—just to generate a single, translatable mRNA molecule.\n\nProcessing of tRNAs and rRNAs\nThe tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these RNAs are not themselves translated. Pre-rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus. Pre-tRNAs are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein synthesis.\n\nMost of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans multiple rRNAs or tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural RNA. Some of the bases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that is, a –CH3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability. Pre-tRNA molecules also undergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined to become tRNAs or rRNAs.\n\nMature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end (Figure  15.4.3\n ). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon\n######################\nOutput:"

Pre-tRNAs are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein synthesis.\\n\\nMost of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans multiple rRNAs or tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural RNA. Some of the bases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that is, a –CH3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability. Pre-tRNA molecules also undergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined to become tRNAs or rRNAs.\\n\\nMature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end (Figure  15.4.3\\n ). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria are remnants of ancient prokaryotes with RNA-based method for regulating gene expression.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA is a molecule that undergoes processing to become mature mRNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Editing\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"RNA editing is a process that may be a holdover from a primordial time when RNA molecules catalyzed reactions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"5' Capping\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"5' capping is the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5' end of pre-mRNA to protect it from degradation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"3' Poly-A Tail\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"3' poly-A tail is a modification that protects pre-mRNA from degradation and signals export to cytoplasm.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA splicing is the process of removing introns and reconnecting exons.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Introns\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Introns are intervening sequences in eukaryotic genes that may be involved in gene regulation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Exons\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Exons are protein-coding sequences in eukaryotic genes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes are complexes of proteins and RNA molecules that conduct pre-mRNA splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"tRNAs\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"tRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"rRNAs\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"rRNAs are structural molecules that make up ribosomes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Editing\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria have an RNA-based method for regulating gene expression, related to RNA editing.\\\"<|>\\\"ancient gene regulation, RNA-based method\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"5' Capping\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA undergoes 5' capping to protect it from degradation.\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA processing, protection from degradation\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"3' Poly-A Tail\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-mRNA undergoes 3' poly-A tail modification to protect it from degradation and signal export to cytoplasm.\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA processing, export to cytoplasm\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Introns\\\"<|>\\\"Exons\\\"<|>\\\"Introns are removed from pre-mRNA to form mature mRNA composed of exons.\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, mRNA processing\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes\\\"<|>\\\"Introns\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes remove introns from pre-mRNA.\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA processing, intron removal\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"tRNAs\\\"<|>\\\"rRNAs\\\"<|>\\\"tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules involved in protein synthesis.\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, structural molecules\\\"<|>5)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA processing, gene regulation, RNA editing, protein synthesis, structural molecules\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end (Figure  15.4.3\n ). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary base pairing.\n\nThe molecular model of phenylalanine tRNA is L-shaped. At one end is the anticodon AAG. At the other end is the attachment site for the amino acid phenylalanine\nFigure  15.4.3\n : This is a space-filling model of a tRNA molecule that adds the amino acid phenylalanine to a growing polypeptide chain. The anticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA. The amino acid phenylalanine is attached to the other end of the tRNA.\nSummary\nEukaryotic pre-mRNAs are modified with a 5' methylguanosine cap and a poly-A tail. These structures protect the mature mRNA from degradation and help export it from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and exons are reconnected with single-nucleotide accuracy. Only finished mRNAs that have undergone 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Pre-rRNAs and pre-tRNAs may be processed by intramolecular cleavage, splicing, methylation, and chemical conversion of nucleotides. Rarely, RNA editing is also performed to insert missing bases after an mRNA has been synthesized.\n\n15.5: Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis\n\nThe synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (other than water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently bonded by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from ~50 amino acid residues to >1,000.\n\nThe synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH2) and a carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (Figure  15.5.1\n ). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.\n\nIllustration shows two amino acids side-by-side. Each amino acid has an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain labeled R or R'. Upon formation of a peptide bond, the amino group is joined to the carboxyl group. A water molecule is released in the process.\nFigure  15.5.1\n : A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, expelling one water molecule. For simplicity in this image, only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond are shown. The R and R' designations refer to the rest of each amino acid structure.\nThe Protein Synthesis Machinery\nIn addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.\n\nRibosomes\nEven before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In E. coli, there are between 10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.\n\nRibosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nMature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end (Figure  15.4.3\\n ). The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an mRNA codon through complementary base pairing.\\n\\nThe molecular model of phenylalanine tRNA is L-shaped. At one end is the anticodon AAG. At the other end is the attachment site for the amino acid phenylalanine\\nFigure  15.4.3\\n : This is a space-filling model of a tRNA molecule that adds the amino acid phenylalanine to a growing polypeptide chain. The anticodon AAG binds the Codon UUC on the mRNA. The amino acid phenylalanine is attached to the other end of the tRNA.\\nSummary\\nEukaryotic pre-mRNAs are modified with a 5' methylguanosine cap and a poly-A tail. These structures protect the mature mRNA from degradation and help export it from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and exons are reconnected with single-nucleotide accuracy. Only finished mRNAs that have undergone 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Pre-rRNAs and pre-tRNAs may be processed by intramolecular cleavage, splicing, methylation, and chemical conversion of nucleotides. Rarely, RNA editing is also performed to insert missing bases after an mRNA has been synthesized.\\n\\n15.5: Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis\\n\\nThe synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (other than water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently bonded by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from ~50 amino acid residues to >1,000.\\n\\nThe synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH2) and a carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (Figure  15.5.1\\n ). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.\\n\\nIllustration shows two amino acids side-by-side. Each amino acid has an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain labeled R or R'. Upon formation of a peptide bond, the amino group is joined to the carboxyl group. A water molecule is released in the process.\\nFigure  15.5.1\\n : A peptide bond links the carboxyl end of one amino acid with the amino end of another, expelling one water molecule. For simplicity in this image, only the functional groups involved in the peptide bond are shown. The R and R' designations refer to the rest of each amino acid structure.\\nThe Protein Synthesis Machinery\\nIn addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.\\n\\nRibosomes\\nEven before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In E. coli, there are between 10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.\\n\\nRibosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"RNA molecules make up a significant portion of a ribosome and have catalytic or binding activities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic Cell\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cells have ribosomes in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a type of bacteria with 10,000 to 70,000 ribosomes present in each cell.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Mitochondria have their own ribosomes in the matrix, which are similar to prokaryotic ribosomes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Chloroplasts\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes in the stroma, which are similar to prokaryotic ribosomes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"tRNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"tRNA molecules have catalytic or binding activities and take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA molecules are templates for protein synthesis and undergo modifications like 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Phenylalanine\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Phenylalanine is an amino acid attached to the other end of a tRNA molecule.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosomes are composed of RNA molecules that have catalytic or binding activities.\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, macromolecule composition\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic Cell\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cells have ribosomes in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular location, protein synthesis\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli has a large number of ribosomes present in each cell.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular composition, prokaryotic cells\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"tRNA\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"tRNA molecules interact with mRNA molecules through complementary base pairing.\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, molecular interaction\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"Phenylalanine\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA molecules are templates for protein synthesis, which involve the attachment of amino acids like phenylalanine.\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, amino acid attachment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, ribosomes, RNA, cellular biology, molecular biology\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

In E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The complete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome.\n\ntRNAs\nThe tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.\n\nOf the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C—three specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine.\n\nAs the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package. Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.\n\nAminoacyl tRNA Synthetases\nThe process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.\n\nThe Mechanism of Protein Synthesis\nAs with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we’ll explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.\n\nInitiation of Translation\nProtein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E. coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator tRNA, called  tRNAMetf\n . The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine called fMet, and can also bind IF-2. Formylated methionine is inserted by  fMet−tRNAMetf\n  at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. When an in-frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet.\n\nIn E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translation—both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome’s translocation.\n\nIn eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\n\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA.

The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we’ll explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.\\n\\nInitiation of Translation\\nProtein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E. coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator tRNA, called  tRNAMetf\\n . The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine called fMet, and can also bind IF-2. Formylated methionine is inserted by  fMet−tRNAMetf\\n  at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. When an in-frame AUG is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet.\\n\\nIn E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translation—both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome’s translocation.\\n\\nIn eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\\n\\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA.

The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\n\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According to Kozak’s rules, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.\n\nOnce the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.\n\nTranslation, Elongation, and Termination\nIn prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of E. coli. The 50S ribosomal subunit of E. coli consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one exception to this assembly line of tRNAs: in E. coli,  fMet−tRNAMetf\n  is capable of entering the P site directly without first entering the A site. Similarly, the eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site. In both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.\n\nDuring translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.\n\nElongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon “step” of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (Figure  15.5.2\n ). Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.\n\nArt Connection\n\nIllustration shows the steps of protein synthesis. First, the initiator tRNA recognizes the sequence AUG on an mRNA that is associated with the small ribosomal subunit. The large subunit then joins the complex. Next, a second tRNA is recruited at the A site. A peptide bond is formed between the first amino acid, which is at the P site, and the second amino acid, which is at the A site. The mRNA then shifts and the first tRNA is moved to the E site, where it dissociates from the ribosome. Another tRNA binds at the A site, and the process is repeated. \nFigure  15.5.2\n : Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon on mRNA. The large ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the components dissociate.\nMany antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein synthesis?\n\nT\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nand nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.\\n\\nInstead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According to Kozak’s rules, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.\\n\\nOnce the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.\\n\\nTranslation, Elongation, and Termination\\nIn prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of E. coli. The 50S ribosomal subunit of E. coli consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one exception to this assembly line of tRNAs: in E. coli,  fMet−tRNAMetf\\n  is capable of entering the P site directly without first entering the A site. Similarly, the eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the P site. In both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.\\n\\nDuring translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each mRNA codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA anticodon is ensured. If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.\\n\\nElongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon “step” of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (Figure  15.5.2\\n ). Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.\\n\\nArt Connection\\n\\nIllustration shows the steps of protein synthesis. First, the initiator tRNA recognizes the sequence AUG on an mRNA that is associated with the small ribosomal subunit. The large subunit then joins the complex. Next, a second tRNA is recruited at the A site. A peptide bond is formed between the first amino acid, which is at the P site, and the second amino acid, which is at the A site. The mRNA then shifts and the first tRNA is moved to the E site, where it dissociates from the ribosome. Another tRNA binds at the A site, and the process is repeated. \\nFigure  15.5.2\\n : Translation begins when an initiator tRNA anticodon recognizes a codon on mRNA. The large ribosomal subunit joins the small subunit, and a second tRNA is recruited. As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the components dissociate.\\nMany antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein synthesis?\\n\\nT\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output for the given text:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a type of bacteria used as a model organism in molecular biology.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Kozak\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Kozak is a scientist who formulated rules for identifying the start codon in vertebrate genes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Shine-Dalgarno sequence\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is a region on the mRNA that helps recruit the ribosome during translation initiation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Met-tRNAi\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Met-tRNAi is a type of initiator tRNA that binds to the start codon during translation initiation in eukaryotes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GTP\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"GTP is a type of nucleoside triphosphate that provides energy for translation elongation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ATP\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"ATP is a type of nucleoside triphosphate that provides energy for various cellular processes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA is a type of RNA that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome during translation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The ribosome is a complex molecular machine that carries out protein synthesis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tetracycline\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Tetracycline is a type of antibiotic that blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Chloramphenicol\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Chloramphenicol is a type of antibiotic that blocks peptidyl transfer during protein synthesis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"Ribosome\\\"<|>\\\"The E. coli ribosome consists of three compartments: the A site, P site, and E site.\\\"<|>\\\"organism, cellular component\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Kozak\\\"<|>\\\"Shine-Dalgarno sequence\\\"<|>\\\"Kozak's rules are used to identify the start codon in vertebrate genes.\\\"<|>\\\"scientist, discovery\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Met-tRNAi\\\"<|>\\\"mRNA\\\"<|>\\\"Met-tRNAi recognizes the start codon on the mRNA during translation initiation.\\\"<|>\\\"molecular recognition, translation initiation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"GTP\\\"<|>\\\"Elongation factor\\\"<|>\\\"GTP provides energy for each step of the ribosome during translation elongation.\\\"<|>\\\"energy source, translation elongation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tetracycline\\\"<|>\\\"A site\\\"<|>\\\"Tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis.\\\"<|>\\\"antibiotic, protein synthesis inhibition\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"protein synthesis, translation, mRNA, ribosome, antibiotics\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

As the mRNA moves relative to the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is formed. Entry of a release factor into the A site terminates translation and the components dissociate.\nMany antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example, tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein synthesis?\n\nTetracycline would directly affect:\n\ntRNA binding to the ribosome\nribosome assembly\ngrowth of the protein chain\nChloramphenicol would directly affect\n\ntRNA binding to the ribosome\nribosome assembly\ngrowth of the protein chain\nTermination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered. Upon aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex. After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction.\n\nProtein Folding, Modification, and Targeting\nDuring and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein “folds” into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein’s “train ticket” to its ultimate destination. Other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment. For instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants). Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.\n\nMany proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.\n\nSummary\nThe players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small ribosomal subunit forms on the mRNA template either at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap (eukaryotes). Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA, specifying methionine. The formation of peptide bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the genetic code. Charged tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site, and their amino acid bonds with the amino acid at the P site. The entire mRNA is translated in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a nonsense codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein. Folding of the protein occurs during and after translation.\n\n16: Gene Expression\n\nWhereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.\n\n16.0: Prelude to Gene Expression\n\nEach somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA. A few exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while producing antibodies. In general, however, the genes that determine whether you have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these organs function quite differently.\nEach somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA.

If each cell has the same DNA, how is it that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver?\n\nPart A depicts a cross section of an eyeball, which has a lens at the front and a cluster of blood vessels at the back.

After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction.\\n\\nProtein Folding, Modification, and Targeting\\nDuring and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein “folds” into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein’s “train ticket” to its ultimate destination. Other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment. For instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants). Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off.\\n\\nMany proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.\\n\\nSummary\\nThe players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small ribosomal subunit forms on the mRNA template either at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap (eukaryotes). Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA, specifying methionine. The formation of peptide bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the genetic code. Charged tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site, and their amino acid bonds with the amino acid at the P site. The entire mRNA is translated in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a nonsense codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein. Folding of the protein occurs during and after translation.\\n\\n16: Gene Expression\\n\\nWhereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.\\n\\n16.0: Prelude to Gene Expression\\n\\nEach somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA. A few exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while producing antibodies.

If each cell has the same DNA, how is it that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver?\n\nPart A depicts a cross section of an eyeball, which has a lens at the front and a cluster of blood vessels at the back. Part B depicts a liver, which is shaped like a triangle. Beneath the liver is a lobe-shaped gall bladder connected to a pancreas by a stem-like vessel. Part C is a sketch, drawn by Leonardo Da Vinci, of a man standing erect with outstretched arms. Superimposed on this image, the man has his legs spread and his arms uplifted.\nFigure 16.0.1\n: The genetic content of each somatic cell in an organism is the same, but not all genes are expressed in every cell. The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a cell is (a) an eye cell or (b) a liver cell. It is the differential gene expression patterns that arise in different cells that give rise to (c) a complete organism.\nWhereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.\n\n16.1: Regulation of Gene Expression\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA.\n\nFor a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time. All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed.\n\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.\n\nThe control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.\n\nProkaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression\nTo understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.\n\nProkaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level.\n\nEukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.1.1\n). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nfast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these organs function quite differently. If each cell has the same DNA, how is it that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver?\\n\\nPart A depicts a cross section of an eyeball, which has a lens at the front and a cluster of blood vessels at the back. Part B depicts a liver, which is shaped like a triangle. Beneath the liver is a lobe-shaped gall bladder connected to a pancreas by a stem-like vessel. Part C is a sketch, drawn by Leonardo Da Vinci, of a man standing erect with outstretched arms. Superimposed on this image, the man has his legs spread and his arms uplifted.\\nFigure 16.0.1\\n: The genetic content of each somatic cell in an organism is the same, but not all genes are expressed in every cell. The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a cell is (a) an eye cell or (b) a liver cell. It is the differential gene expression patterns that arise in different cells that give rise to (c) a complete organism.\\nWhereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.\\n\\n16.1: Regulation of Gene Expression\\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA.\\n\\nFor a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time. All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed.\\n\\nThe regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.\\n\\nThe control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.\\n\\nProkaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression\\nTo understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.\\n\\nProkaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level.\\n\\nEukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (Figure 16.1.1\\n). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eye Cell\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Eye cells are specialized cells that make up the eye and perform specific functions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Liver Cell \\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Liver cells are specialized cells that make up the liver and perform specific functions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Organism\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"An organism is a living being comprised of multiple cells, organs, and systems that work together to maintain life.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo Da Vinci\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo Da Vinci was a historical figure who created artistic and scientific works, including a sketch of a man.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eyeball\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The eyeball is a physical structure that houses the lens, blood vessels, and other components of the eye.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Liver\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The liver is a physical organ with a triangular shape that performs various functions in the body.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gall Bladder\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The gall bladder is a small organ connected to the liver and pancreas by a stem-like vessel.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pancreas\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The pancreas is an organ connected to the gall bladder by a stem-like vessel and performs digestive functions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eye Cell\\\"<|>\\\"Eyeball\\\"<|>\\\"Eye cells make up the structure of the eyeball and perform specific functions.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular composition, anatomical structure\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Liver Cell\\\"<|>\\\"Liver\\\"<|>\\\"Liver cells make up the liver organ and perform specific functions.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular composition, anatomical structure\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Organism\\\"<|>\\\"Eye Cell\\\"<|>\\\"The organism is comprised of multiple cells, including eye cells, that work together to maintain life.\\\"<|>\\\"organismal composition, cellular diversity\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Organism\\\"<|>\\\"Liver Cell\\\"<|>\\\"The organism is comprised of multiple cells, including liver cells, that work together to maintain life.\\\"<|>\\\"organismal composition, cellular diversity\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo Da Vinci\\\"<|>\\\"Eyeball\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo Da Vinci created a sketch of a man that included a depiction of an eyeball.\\\"<|>\\\"artistic representation, anatomical structure\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"cellular biology, gene expression, organ structure, anatomy, organismal composition\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made (post-translational level).\n\nProkaryotic cells do not have a nucleus, and DNA is located in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes attach to the mRNA as it is being transcribed from DNA. Thus, transcription and translation occur simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is located in the nucleus, and ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm. After being transcribed, pre-mRNA is processed in the nucleus to make the mature mRNA, which is then exported to the cytoplasm where ribosomes become associated with it and translation begins.\nFigure 16.1.1\n: Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously in the cytoplasm, and regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during transcription and RNA processing, which take place in the nucleus, and during protein translation, which takes place in the cytoplasm. Further regulation may occur through post-translational modifications of proteins.\nThe differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized below. The regulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules.\n\nTable 16.1.1\n: Differences in the Regulation of Gene Expression of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Organisms\n\nProkaryotic organisms\tEukaryotic organisms\nLack nucleus\tContain nucleus\nDNA is found in the cytoplasm\tDNA is confined to the nuclear compartment\nRNA transcription and protein formation occur almost simultaneously\tRNA transcription occurs prior to protein formation, and it takes place in the nucleus. Translation of RNA to protein occurs in the cytoplasm.\nGene expression is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level\tGene expression is regulated at many levels (epigenetic, transcriptional, nuclear shuttling, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational)\nEvolution Connection: Evolution of Gene Regulation\n\nProkaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription. As eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present outside the nucleus.\n\nSome cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself. Cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not. Therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring.\n\nSummary\nWhile all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA, not all cells within that organism express the same proteins. Prokaryotic organisms express the entire DNA they encode in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. Proteins are expressed only when they are needed. Eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded in any given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression. To express a protein, the DNA is first transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, these processes occur almost simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated only at the transcriptional level, whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels.\n\n16.2: Prokaryotic Gene Regulation\nThe DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon.\n\nThe DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon.\n\nIn prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.\n\nThe trp Operon: A Repressor Operon\nBacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive.

As eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the DNA was formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present outside the nucleus.\\n\\nSome cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself. Cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not. Therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring.\\n\\nSummary\\nWhile all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA, not all cells within that organism express the same proteins. Prokaryotic organisms express the entire DNA they encode in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. Proteins are expressed only when they are needed. Eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded in any given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression. To express a protein, the DNA is first transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic cells, these processes occur almost simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated only at the transcriptional level, whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels.\\n\\n16.2: Prokaryotic Gene Regulation\\nThe DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon.\\n\\nThe DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm.

For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon.\\n\\nIn prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.\\n\\nThe trp Operon: A Repressor Operon\\nBacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive.

Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.\n\nThe trp Operon: A Repressor Operon\nBacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive. Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment. E. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.2.1\n). If tryptophan is present in the environment, then E. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.\n\nThe trp operon has a promoter, an operator, and five genes named trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA that are located in sequential order on the DNA. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. When tryptophan is present, the trp repressor binds the operator and prevents the RNA polymerase from moving past the operator; therefore, RNA synthesis is blocked. In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor dissociates from the operator. RNA polymerase can now slide past the operator, and transcription begins.\nFigure 16.2.1\n: The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other in the trp operon. When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence. This physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.\nA DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.\n\nA DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene. This operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes shape to bind to the trp operator. Binding of the tryptophan–repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes.\n\nWhen tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators.\n\nCatabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator\nJust as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, E. coli bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E. coli. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (CAP), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.2.2\n). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.\n\nThe lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes named lacZ, lacY, and lacA that are located in sequential order on the DNA. In the absence of cAMP, the CAP protein does not bind the DNA. RNA polymerase binds the promoter, and transcription occurs at a slow rate. In the presence of cAMP, a CAP–cAMP complex binds to the promoter and increases RNA polymerase activity. As a result, the rate of RNA synthesis is increased.\nFigure 16.2.2\n: When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.\nThe lac Operon: An\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nrepressors, activators, and inducers. Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.\\n\\nThe trp Operon: A Repressor Operon\\nBacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive. Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment. E. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.2.1\\n). If tryptophan is present in the environment, then E. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized.\\n\\nThe trp operon has a promoter, an operator, and five genes named trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA that are located in sequential order on the DNA. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. When tryptophan is present, the trp repressor binds the operator and prevents the RNA polymerase from moving past the operator; therefore, RNA synthesis is blocked. In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor dissociates from the operator. RNA polymerase can now slide past the operator, and transcription begins.\\nFigure 16.2.1\\n: The five genes that are needed to synthesize tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other in the trp operon. When tryptophan is plentiful, two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor protein at the operator sequence. This physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.\\nA DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site. This is the region of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.\\n\\nA DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene. This operator contains the DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes shape to bind to the trp operator. Binding of the tryptophan–repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes.\\n\\nWhen tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators.\\n\\nCatabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator\\nJust as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, E. coli bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E. coli. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (CAP), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.2.2\\n). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.\\n\\nThe lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes named lacZ, lacY, and lacA that are located in sequential order on the DNA. In the absence of cAMP, the CAP protein does not bind the DNA. RNA polymerase binds the promoter, and transcription occurs at a slow rate. In the presence of cAMP, a CAP–cAMP complex binds to the promoter and increases RNA polymerase activity. As a result, the rate of RNA synthesis is increased.\\nFigure 16.2.2\\n: When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.\\nThe lac Operon: An\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a type of bacteria that needs amino acids to survive.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tryptophan\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Tryptophan is an amino acid that E. coli can ingest or synthesize.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"trp Operon\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The trp operon is a genetic operon that regulates the synthesis of tryptophan in E. coli.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase is an enzyme that binds to the promoter region to initiate transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Repressor Protein\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"The repressor protein is a protein that binds to the operator region to prevent transcription when tryptophan is present.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Operator Sequence\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The operator sequence is a DNA region where the repressor protein binds to regulate transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP)\\\"<\\\"|\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"CAP is a protein that binds to the promoter region to increase transcription of genes involved in alternative sugar processing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cyclic AMP (cAMP)\\\"<\\\"|\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"cAMP is a signaling molecule involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E. coli.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Lac Operon\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The lac operon is a genetic operon that regulates the transcription of genes involved in alternative sugar processing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"Tryptophan\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli needs tryptophan to survive and can synthesize it using the trp operon.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular need, amino acid synthesis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"trp Operon\\\"<|>\\\"Repressor Protein\\\"<|>\\\"The repressor protein regulates the transcription of the trp operon.\\\"<|>\\\"transcription regulation, gene expression\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"trp Operon\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase initiates transcription of the trp operon.\\\"<|>\\\"transcription initiation, gene expression\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP)\\\"<\\\"|\\\"Cyclic AMP (cAMP)\\\"<\\\"|\\\"The CAP protein binds to cAMP to regulate transcription of genes involved in alternative sugar processing.\\\"<|>\\\"signaling pathway, gene regulation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Lac Operon\\\"<|>\\\"Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP)\\\"<\\\"|\\\"The lac operon is regulated by the CAP protein.\\\"<|>\\\"transcription regulation, gene expression\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, transcription, operon, bacteria, metabolism\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\\n\\nNote: The output is formatted according to the specified format, with each entity and relationship represented as a tuple with the relevant information.

As a result, the rate of RNA synthesis is increased.\nFigure 16.2.2\n: When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP protein, a positive regulator that binds to an operator region upstream of the genes required to use other sugar sources.\nThe lac Operon: An Inducer Operon\nThe third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The lac operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, E. coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. To do so, the cAMP–CAP protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar source is lactose. The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. CAP binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon. However, for the lac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lac operon be transcribed (Figure 16.2.3\n). This makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.\n\nArt Connection\n\nThe lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes named lacZ, lacY, and lacA. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor binds to the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In the presence of lactose, the repressor is released from the operator, and transcription proceeds at a slow rate. Binding of the cAMP–CAP complex to the promoter stimulates RNA polymerase activity and increases RNA synthesis. However, even in the presence of the cAMP–CAP complex, RNA synthesis is blocked if the repressor binds to the promoter.\nFigure 16.2.3\n: Transcription of the lac operon is carefully regulated so that its expression only occurs when glucose is limited and lactose is present to serve as an alternative fuel source.\nIn E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off. Why do you think this is the case?\n\nIf glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off. Only when both conditions are satisfied is the lac operon transcribed (Table 16.2.1\n).\n\nTable 16.2.1\n: Signals that Induce or Repress Transcription of the lac Operon\nGlucose\tCAP binds\tLactose\tRepressor binds\tTranscription\n+\t-\t-\t+\tNo\n+\t-\t+\t-\tSome\n-\t+\t-\t+\tNo\n-\t+\t+\t-\tYes\n\nSummary\nThe regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the trp operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example—the lac operon—two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the lac operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.\n\n16.3: Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation\nEukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different levels. Eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA. This form of regulation, called epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated.\n\nEukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated.

Why do you think this is the case?\\n\\nIf glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off. Only when both conditions are satisfied is the lac operon transcribed (Table 16.2.1\\n).\\n\\nTable 16.2.1\\n: Signals that Induce or Repress Transcription of the lac Operon\\nGlucose\\tCAP binds\\tLactose\\tRepressor binds\\tTranscription\\n+\\t-\\t-\\t+\\tNo\\n+\\t-\\t+\\t-\\tSome\\n-\\t+\\t-\\t+\\tNo\\n-\\t+\\t+\\t-\\tYes\\n\\nSummary\\nThe regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the trp operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example—the lac operon—two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the lac operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.\\n\\n16.3: Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation\\nEukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different levels. Eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA.

This form of regulation, called epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated.\n\nEpigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the Chromosome\nThe human genome encodes over 20,000 genes; each of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes encodes thousands of genes. The DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. It is also organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.\n\nThe first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins. Histones package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions (Figure 16.3.1\na). Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads on a string (Figure 16.3.1\nb). These beads (histone proteins) can move along the string (DNA) and change the structure of the molecule.\n\nPart A depicts a nucleosome composed of spherical histone proteins that are fused together. A double-stranded DNA helix wraps around the nucleosome twice. Free DNA extends from either end of the nucleosome.  Part B is an electron micrograph of DNA that is associated with nucleosomes. Each nucleosome looks like a bead. The beads are connected together by free DNA. Nine beads strung together is approximately 150 nm across.\nFigure 16.3.1\n: DNA is folded around histone proteins to create (a) nucleosome complexes. These nucleosomes control the access of proteins to the underlying DNA. When viewed through an electron microscope (b), the nucleosomes look like beads on a string. (credit “micrograph”: modification of work by Chris Woodcock)\nIf DNA encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into RNA, the nucleosomes surrounding that region of DNA can slide down the DNA to open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase) to initiate transcription (Figure 16.3.2\n). Nucleosomes can move to open the chromosome structure to expose a segment of DNA, but do so in a very controlled manner.\n\nArt Connection\n\nNucleosomes are depicted as wheel-like structures. The nucleosomes are made up of histones, and have DNA wrapped around the outside. Each histone has a tail that juts out from the wheel. When DNA and the histone tails are methylated, the nucleosomes pack tightly together so there is no free DNA. Transcription factors cannot bind, and genes are not expressed. Acetylation of histone tails results in a looser packing of the nucleosomes. Free DNA is exposed between the nucleosomes, and transcription factors are able to bind genes on this exposed DNA.\nFigure 16.3.2\n: Nucleosomes can slide along DNA. When nucleosomes are spaced closely together (top), transcription factors cannot bind and gene expression is turned off. When the nucleosomes are spaced far apart (bottom), the DNA is exposed. Transcription factors can bind, allowing gene expression to occur. Modifications to the histones and DNA affect nucleosome spacing.\nIn females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of epigenetic changes to the chromatin. What impact do you think these changes would have on nucleosome packing?\n\nHow the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the histone proteins and on the DNA. These signals are tags added to histone proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed (Figure 16.3.3\n) depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as needed. They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in the protein or to the nucleotides of the DNA. The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how tightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.\n\nThe DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of genes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.\n\nIllustration shows a chromosome that is partially unraveled and magnified, revealing histone proteins wound around the DNA double helix. Histones are proteins around which DNA winds for compaction and gene regulation. Methylation of DNA and chemical modification of histone tails are known as epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes alter the spacing of nucleosomes and change gene expression. Epigenetic changes may result from development, either in utero or in childhood, environmental chemicals, drugs, aging, or diet. Epigenetic changes may result in cancer, autoimmune disease, mental disorders, and diabetes.\nFigure 16.3.3\n: Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene expression. (credit: modification of work by\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the DNA. This form of regulation, called epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated.\\n\\nEpigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the Chromosome\\nThe human genome encodes over 20,000 genes; each of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes encodes thousands of genes. The DNA in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. It is also organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type.\\n\\nThe first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of DNA strands around histone proteins. Histones package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the DNA regions (Figure 16.3.1\\na). Under the electron microscope, this winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads on a string (Figure 16.3.1\\nb). These beads (histone proteins) can move along the string (DNA) and change the structure of the molecule.\\n\\nPart A depicts a nucleosome composed of spherical histone proteins that are fused together. A double-stranded DNA helix wraps around the nucleosome twice. Free DNA extends from either end of the nucleosome.  Part B is an electron micrograph of DNA that is associated with nucleosomes. Each nucleosome looks like a bead. The beads are connected together by free DNA. Nine beads strung together is approximately 150 nm across.\\nFigure 16.3.1\\n: DNA is folded around histone proteins to create (a) nucleosome complexes. These nucleosomes control the access of proteins to the underlying DNA. When viewed through an electron microscope (b), the nucleosomes look like beads on a string. (credit “micrograph”: modification of work by Chris Woodcock)\\nIf DNA encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into RNA, the nucleosomes surrounding that region of DNA can slide down the DNA to open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase) to initiate transcription (Figure 16.3.2\\n). Nucleosomes can move to open the chromosome structure to expose a segment of DNA, but do so in a very controlled manner.\\n\\nArt Connection\\n\\nNucleosomes are depicted as wheel-like structures. The nucleosomes are made up of histones, and have DNA wrapped around the outside. Each histone has a tail that juts out from the wheel. When DNA and the histone tails are methylated, the nucleosomes pack tightly together so there is no free DNA. Transcription factors cannot bind, and genes are not expressed. Acetylation of histone tails results in a looser packing of the nucleosomes. Free DNA is exposed between the nucleosomes, and transcription factors are able to bind genes on this exposed DNA.\\nFigure 16.3.2\\n: Nucleosomes can slide along DNA. When nucleosomes are spaced closely together (top), transcription factors cannot bind and gene expression is turned off. When the nucleosomes are spaced far apart (bottom), the DNA is exposed. Transcription factors can bind, allowing gene expression to occur. Modifications to the histones and DNA affect nucleosome spacing.\\nIn females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic development because of epigenetic changes to the chromatin. What impact do you think these changes would have on nucleosome packing?\\n\\nHow the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the histone proteins and on the DNA. These signals are tags added to histone proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed (Figure 16.3.3\\n) depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA). These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as needed. They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in the protein or to the nucleotides of the DNA. The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter how tightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.\\n\\nThe DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of genes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.\\n\\nIllustration shows a chromosome that is partially unraveled and magnified, revealing histone proteins wound around the DNA double helix. Histones are proteins around which DNA winds for compaction and gene regulation. Methylation of DNA and chemical modification of histone tails are known as epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes alter the spacing of nucleosomes and change gene expression. Epigenetic changes may result from development, either in utero or in childhood, environmental chemicals, drugs, aging, or diet. Epigenetic changes may result in cancer, autoimmune disease, mental disorders, and diabetes.\\nFigure 16.3.3\\n: Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene expression.

Epigenetic changes alter the spacing of nucleosomes and change gene expression. Epigenetic changes may result from development, either in utero or in childhood, environmental chemicals, drugs, aging, or diet. Epigenetic changes may result in cancer, autoimmune disease, mental disorders, and diabetes.\nFigure 16.3.3\n: Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene expression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nThis type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic means “around genetics.” The changes that occur to the histone proteins and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent. Instead, these changes are temporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins and DNA. If a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene. This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription. If a gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.3.3\n).\n\nSummary\nIn eukaryotic cells, the first stage of gene expression control occurs at the epigenetic level. Epigenetic mechanisms control access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to be turned on or off. These mechanisms control how DNA is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the DNA is wound around histone proteins. The addition or removal of chemical modifications (or flags) to histone proteins or DNA signals to the cell to open or close a chromosomal region. Therefore, eukaryotic cells can control whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to transcription factors and the binding of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.\n\n16.4: Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation\nLike prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene.\n\nLike prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.\n\nThe Promoter and the Transcription Machinery\nGenes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription.\n\nWithin the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. This box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the TATA box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the transcription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator proteins (Figure  16.4.1\n ).\n\nEukaryotic gene expression is controlled by a promoter immediately adjacent to the gene, and an enhancer far upstream. The DNA folds over itself, bringing the enhancer next to the promoter. Transcription factors and mediator proteins are sandwiched between the promoter and the enhancer. Short DNA sequences within the enhancer called distal control elements bind activators, which in turn bind transcription factors and mediator proteins bound to the promoter. RNA polymerase binds the complex, allowing transcription to begin. Different genes have enhancers with different distal control elements, allowing differential regulation of transcription.\nFigure  16.4.1\n : An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter\n######################\nOutput:"

Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the transcription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator proteins (Figure  16.4.1\\n ).\\n\\nEukaryotic gene expression is controlled by a promoter immediately adjacent to the gene, and an enhancer far upstream. The DNA folds over itself, bringing the enhancer next to the promoter. Transcription factors and mediator proteins are sandwiched between the promoter and the enhancer. Short DNA sequences within the enhancer called distal control elements bind activators, which in turn bind transcription factors and mediator proteins bound to the promoter. RNA polymerase binds the complex, allowing transcription to begin. Different genes have enhancers with different distal control elements, allowing differential regulation of transcription.\\nFigure  16.4.1\\n : An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors.

RNA polymerase binds the complex, allowing transcription to begin. Different genes have enhancers with different distal control elements, allowing differential regulation of transcription.\nFigure  16.4.1\n : An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements, enabling differential gene expression.\nIn addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription. These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene. There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.\n\nEnhancers and Transcription\nIn some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called enhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.\n\nEnhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape of the DNA changes (Figure  16.4.1\n ). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.\n\nTurning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors\nLike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.\n\nSummary\nTo start transcription, general transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIH, and others, must first bind to the TATA box and recruit RNA polymerase to that location. The binding of additional regulatory transcription factors to cis-acting elements will either increase or prevent transcription. In addition to promoter sequences, enhancer regions help augment transcription. Enhancers can be upstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other chromosomes. Transcription factors bind to enhancer regions to increase or prevent transcription.\n\n16.5: Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation\nRNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.\n\nRNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.\n\nRNA splicing, the first stage of post-transcriptional control\nIn eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (Figure  16.5.1\n ). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.\n\nA pre-mRNA has four exons separated by three introns. The pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create two different proteins, each with three exons. One protein contains exons one, two, and three. The other protein contains exons one, three and four.\nFigure  16.5.1\n : Pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create different proteins.\nEvolution Connection: Alternative RNA Splicing\n\nIn the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (Figure  16.5.2\n ). This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\n\nDiagram shows five methods of alternative splicing\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nin turn bind transcription factors and mediator proteins bound to the promoter. RNA polymerase binds the complex, allowing transcription to begin. Different genes have enhancers with different distal control elements, allowing differential regulation of transcription.\\nFigure  16.4.1\\n : An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements, enabling differential gene expression.\\nIn addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription. These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene. There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.\\n\\nEnhancers and Transcription\\nIn some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called enhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.\\n\\nEnhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape of the DNA changes (Figure  16.4.1\\n ). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.\\n\\nTurning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors\\nLike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.\\n\\nSummary\\nTo start transcription, general transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIH, and others, must first bind to the TATA box and recruit RNA polymerase to that location. The binding of additional regulatory transcription factors to cis-acting elements will either increase or prevent transcription. In addition to promoter sequences, enhancer regions help augment transcription. Enhancers can be upstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other chromosomes. Transcription factors bind to enhancer regions to increase or prevent transcription.\\n\\n16.5: Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation\\nRNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.\\n\\nRNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.\\n\\nRNA splicing, the first stage of post-transcriptional control\\nIn eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (Figure  16.5.1\\n ). After an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.\\n\\nA pre-mRNA has four exons separated by three introns. The pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create two different proteins, each with three exons. One protein contains exons one, two, and three. The other protein contains exons one, three and four.\\nFigure  16.5.1\\n : Pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to create different proteins.\\nEvolution Connection: Alternative RNA Splicing\\n\\nIn the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (Figure  16.5.2\\n ). This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\\n\\nDiagram shows five methods of alternative splicing\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TFIID\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"TFIID is a general transcription factor that binds to the TATA box and recruits RNA polymerase.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TFIIH\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"TFIIH is a general transcription factor involved in the initiation of transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"RNA polymerase is an enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Enhancer\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription by binding transcription factors.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Promoter\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A promoter is a region of DNA where transcription factors bind to initiate transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cis-acting Element\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A cis-acting element is a region of DNA where transcription factors bind to regulate gene expression.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transcription Factor Binding Site\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A transcription factor binding site is a specific DNA sequence where transcription factors bind to regulate gene expression.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional Activators\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional activators are proteins that bind to enhancers and promoters to increase transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional Repressors\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional repressors are proteins that bind to promoter or enhancer regions to block transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic Cells\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cells are a type of cell that has mechanisms to regulate gene expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional modification.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Post-transcriptional Modification\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Post-transcriptional modification is the process of processing RNA into a mature form before translation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA splicing is the process of removing introns and joining exons to form a mature RNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Introns\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Introns are regions of RNA that are removed prior to translation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Exons\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Exons are regions of RNA that code for protein and are joined together after splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TFIID\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"TFIID recruits RNA polymerase to the promoter region.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-protein interaction, transcription initiation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Enhancer\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional Activators\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional activators bind to enhancers to increase transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-DNA interaction, transcription activation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional Repressors\\\"<|>\\\"Promoter\\\"<|>\\\"Transcriptional repressors bind to promoters or enhancers to block transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-DNA interaction, transcription repression\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"Post-transcriptional Modification\\\"<|>\\\"RNA splicing is a stage of post-transcriptional modification.\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, RNA processing\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic Cells\\\"<|>\\\"Post-transcriptional Modification\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic cells have mechanisms to regulate gene expression through post-transcriptional modification.\\\"<|>\\\"cell biology, gene regulation\\\"<|>5)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"gene expression, transcription regulation, post-transcriptional modification, RNA splicing, eukaryotic cells\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\n\nDiagram shows five methods of alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. When exon skipping occurs, an exon is spliced out in one mature mRNA product and retained in another. When mutually exclusive exons are present in the pre-mRNA, only one is retained in the mature mRNA. When an alternative 5’ donor site is present, the location of the 5’ splice site is variable. When an alternative 3’ acceptor site is present, the location of the 3’ splice site is variable. Intron retention results in an intron being retained in one mature mRNA and spliced out in another.\nFigure  16.5.2\n : There are five basic modes of alternative splicing.\nHow could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon. In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such “mistakes” would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence. However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.\n\nControl of RNA Stability\nBefore the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective \"caps\" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. The 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The poly-A tail, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for translation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.\n\nBinding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the protein-coding region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' UTR (Figure  16.5.3\n ). The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that binds.\n\nIn the mature RNA molecule, exons are spliced together between the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. A 5' cap is attached to the 5' untranslated region, and a poly-A tail is attached to the 3' untranslated region. RNA-binding proteins associate with the 5' and 3' untranslated regions.\nFigure  16.5.3\n : The protein-coding region of mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.\nRNA Stability and microRNAs\nIn addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule. These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21–24 nucleotides in length. The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however, miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy the RNA molecule.\n\nSummary\nPost-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\\n\\nDiagram shows five methods of alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. When exon skipping occurs, an exon is spliced out in one mature mRNA product and retained in another. When mutually exclusive exons are present in the pre-mRNA, only one is retained in the mature mRNA. When an alternative 5’ donor site is present, the location of the 5’ splice site is variable. When an alternative 3’ acceptor site is present, the location of the 3’ splice site is variable. Intron retention results in an intron being retained in one mature mRNA and spliced out in another.\\nFigure  16.5.2\\n : There are five basic modes of alternative splicing.\\nHow could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon. In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such “mistakes” would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence. However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.\\n\\nControl of RNA Stability\\nBefore the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective \\\"caps\\\" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. The 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The poly-A tail, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for translation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.\\n\\nBinding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the protein-coding region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' UTR (Figure  16.5.3\\n ). The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that binds.\\n\\nIn the mature RNA molecule, exons are spliced together between the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. A 5' cap is attached to the 5' untranslated region, and a poly-A tail is attached to the 3' untranslated region. RNA-binding proteins associate with the 5' and 3' untranslated regions.\\nFigure  16.5.3\\n : The protein-coding region of mRNA is flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3' UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.\\nRNA Stability and microRNAs\\nIn addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule. These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21–24 nucleotides in length. The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a protein called dicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however, miRNAs also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy the RNA molecule.\\n\\nSummary\\nPost-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative splicing is a mechanism of gene regulation where the frequency of different splicing alternatives is controlled by the cell.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotes\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotes are a group of organisms where alternative splicing is a common mechanism of gene regulation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Humans\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Humans are a species where 70 percent of genes are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cell\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The cell is a biological unit that controls the production of different protein products through alternative splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Intron\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Intron is a region in pre-mRNA that is spliced out during alternative splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Exon\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Exon is a region in pre-mRNA that is retained during alternative splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Regulation\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Gene regulation is the process by which cells control the expression of genes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Stability\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA stability refers to the rate of decay of RNA molecules in the cytoplasm.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-Binding Proteins\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-binding proteins are proteins that bind to RNA and influence its stability.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Untranslated Regions\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Untranslated regions are regions in RNA that are not translated into protein and regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs are short RNA molecules that bind to RNA and regulate its stability.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Regulation\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative splicing is a mechanism of gene regulation.\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, alternative splicing\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotes\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative splicing is a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes.\\\"<|>\\\"alternative splicing, eukaryotes\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Humans\\\"<|>\\\"Alternative Splicing\\\"<|>\\\"70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.\\\"<|>\\\"alternative splicing, human genes\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cell\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Stability\\\"<|>\\\"The cell controls RNA stability through various mechanisms.\\\"<|>\\\"cell regulation, RNA stability\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Intron\\\"<|>\\\"Exon\\\"<|>\\\"Introns are spliced out and exons are retained during alternative splicing.\\\"<|>\\\"alternative splicing, exon/intron\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Stability\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-Binding Proteins\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-binding proteins influence RNA stability.\\\"<|>\\\"RNA stability, protein binding\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Stability\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs regulate RNA stability by binding to RNA and degrading target mRNA.\\\"<|>\\\"RNA stability, microRNA regulation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, alternative splicing, RNA stability, microRNAs, eukaryotes, human genes\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy the RNA molecule.\n\nSummary\nPost-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together. Once this occurs, the RNA is mature and can be translated. RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it resides there before being degraded, called RNA stability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of protein that is synthesized. The RNA stability can be increased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased, leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis. RNA stability is controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and miRNAs bind to the 5' UTR or the 3' UTR of the RNA to increase or decrease RNA stability. Depending on the RBP, the stability can be increased or decreased significantly; however, miRNAs always decrease stability and promote decay.\n\n16.6: Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene Regulation\nAfter the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on the RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\n\nAfter the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on the RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\n\nThe Initiation Complex and Translation Rate\nLike transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. In translation, the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex. The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high-energy molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit. When bound, the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex, bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated. At this point, when the initiator complex is assembled, the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released. The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is impeded (Figure 16.6.1\n). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, it binds the RNA and actively translates the protein.\n\nArt Connection\n\nThe eIF2 protein is a translation factor that binds to the small 40S ribosome subunit. When eIF2 is phosphorylated, translation is blocked.\nFigure 16.6.1\n: Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.\nAn increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?\n\nChemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity\nProteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane.\n\nChemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).\n\nThe addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nto degrade the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy the RNA molecule.\\n\\nSummary\\nPost-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together. Once this occurs, the RNA is mature and can be translated. RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it resides there before being degraded, called RNA stability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of protein that is synthesized. The RNA stability can be increased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased, leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis. RNA stability is controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and miRNAs bind to the 5' UTR or the 3' UTR of the RNA to increase or decrease RNA stability. Depending on the RBP, the stability can be increased or decreased significantly; however, miRNAs always decrease stability and promote decay.\\n\\n16.6: Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene Regulation\\nAfter the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on the RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\\n\\nAfter the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on the RNA molecule. As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. As the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes.\\n\\nThe Initiation Complex and Translation Rate\\nLike transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. In translation, the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex. The first protein to bind to the RNA to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-2 protein is active when it binds to the high-energy molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit. When bound, the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S ribosome complex, bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated. At this point, when the initiator complex is assembled, the GTP is converted into GDP and energy is released. The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to translate the RNA. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is impeded (Figure 16.6.1\\n). When eIF-2 remains unphosphorylated, it binds the RNA and actively translates the protein.\\n\\nArt Connection\\n\\nThe eIF2 protein is a translation factor that binds to the small 40S ribosome subunit. When eIF2 is phosphorylated, translation is blocked.\\nFigure 16.6.1\\n: Gene expression can be controlled by factors that bind the translation initiation complex.\\nAn increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?\\n\\nChemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity\\nProteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane.\\n\\nChemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).\\n\\nThe addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RISC complex\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The RISC complex is a molecular complex involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, specifically in RNA interference.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"miRNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNA is a type of non-coding RNA that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to target mRNAs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes are molecular complexes responsible for removing introns and joining exons during RNA splicing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nuclear pore complex\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The nuclear pore complex is a protein structure responsible for transporting RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-binding proteins (RPBs)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) are proteins that bind to RNA molecules to regulate their stability and translation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs (miRNAs)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs and promoting their degradation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2)\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) is a protein involved in the initiation of translation, specifically in the binding of GTP and the small 40S ribosomal subunit.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is a high-energy molecule that provides energy for the initiation of translation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Guanosine diphosphate (GDP)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is a low-energy molecule resulting from the hydrolysis of GTP during translation initiation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Alzheimer’s disease\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Parkinson’s disease\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and protein misfolding.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Huntington’s disease\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ubiquitin\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Ubiquitin is a protein that marks other proteins for degradation by the proteasome.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Proteasome\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The proteasome is an organelle responsible for degrading proteins marked by ubiquitin for degradation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RISC complex\\\"<|>\\\"miRNA\\\"<|>\\\"The RISC complex works with miRNAs to degrade target mRNAs.\\\"<|>\\\"RNA interference, post-transcriptional regulation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-binding proteins (RPBs)\\\"<|>\\\"Spliceosomes work together with RPBs to process and stabilize RNA molecules.\\\"<|>\\\"RNA splicing, RNA stability\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2)\\\"<|>\\\"Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)\\\"<|>\\\"eIF-2 binds to GTP to initiate translation.\\\"<|>\\\"translation initiation, energy coupling\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MicroRNAs (miRNAs)\\\"<|>\\\"RNA-binding proteins (RPBs)\\\"<|>\\\"miRNAs and RPBs bind to RNA molecules to regulate their stability and translation.\\\"<|>\\\"RNA regulation, post-transcriptional control\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alzheimer’s disease\\\"<|>\\\"Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2)\\\"<|>\\\"Increased phosphorylation of eIF-2 is observed in Alzheimer’s disease, affecting protein synthesis.\\\"<|>\\\"neurodegenerative disease, protein synthesis regulation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, post-transcriptional control, RNA stability, translation initiation, neurodegenerative diseases\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.6.2\n). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.\n\nMultiple ubiquitin groups bind to a protein. The tagged protein is then fed into the hollow tube of a proteasome. The proteasome degrades the protein.\nFigure 16.6.2\n: Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.\nSummary\nChanging the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein, the function of the protein, or how long it is found in the cell. To translate the protein, a protein initiator complex must assemble on the RNA. Modifications (such as phosphorylation) of proteins in this complex can prevent proper translation from occurring. Once a protein has been synthesized, it can be modified (phosphorylated, acetylated, methylated, or ubiquitinated). These post-translational modifications can greatly impact the stability, degradation, or function of the protein.\n\n16.7: Cancer and Gene Regulation\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\n\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\n\nFor cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer.\n\nCancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).\n\nChanges in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be detected in cancer. While these changes don’t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells. Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.\n\nTumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer\nIn normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor suppressor genes in cells. The most studied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself functions as a transcription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.\n\nProto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer. Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes can alter transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.\n\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins\n######################\nOutput:"

(increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).\\n\\nThe addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.6.2\\n). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.\\n\\nMultiple ubiquitin groups bind to a protein. The tagged protein is then fed into the hollow tube of a proteasome. The proteasome degrades the protein.\\nFigure 16.6.2\\n: Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.\\nSummary\\nChanging the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein, the function of the protein, or how long it is found in the cell. To translate the protein, a protein initiator complex must assemble on the RNA. Modifications (such as phosphorylation) of proteins in this complex can prevent proper translation from occurring. Once a protein has been synthesized, it can be modified (phosphorylated, acetylated, methylated, or ubiquitinated). These post-translational modifications can greatly impact the stability, degradation, or function of the protein.\\n\\n16.7: Cancer and Gene Regulation\\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\\n\\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\\n\\nFor cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer.\\n\\nCancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression\\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).\\n\\nChanges in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be detected in cancer. While these changes don’t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells. Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.\\n\\nTumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer\\nIn normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor suppressor genes in cells. The most studied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself functions as a transcription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.\\n\\nProto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer. Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes can alter transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.\\n\\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Proteasome\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The proteasome is an organelle that functions to remove proteins, marking them for degradation\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a molecule essential for protein synthesis and regulation\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Protein initiator complex\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The protein initiator complex assembles on RNA to translate proteins\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cyclin B\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"Cyclin B is a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"p53\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that functions as a transcription factor, preventing uncontrolled cell growth\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Myc\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"<|>\\\"Myc is a transcription factor involved in cancer, aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Histone proteins\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Histone proteins are involved in epigenetic regulation, specifically histone acetylation\\\">)##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ubiquitin\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Ubiquitin is a protein that marks other proteins for degradation, functioning as a flag indicating protein lifespan completion\\\">)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"Protein initiator complex\\\"<|>\\\"RNA is translated into protein by the protein initiator complex.\\\"<|>\\\"translation, protein synthesis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cyclin B\\\"<|>\\\"Cell cycle\\\"<|>\\\"Cyclin B controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle.\\\"<|>\\\"cell cycle regulation, checkpoint protein\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"p53\\\"<|>\\\"Cell growth\\\"<|>\\\"p53 prevents uncontrolled cell growth by regulating transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"tumor suppression, cell growth regulation\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Myc\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer\\\"<|>\\\"Myc is involved in cancer, specifically Burkett’s Lymphoma, and causes uncontrolled cell growth.\\\"<|>\\\"oncogene, cancer development\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Histone proteins\\\"<|>\\\"Epigenetic regulation\\\"<|>\\\"Histone proteins are involved in epigenetic regulation, specifically histone acetylation.\\\"<|>\\\"epigenetic modification, gene expression\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ubiquitin\\\"<|>\\\"Proteasome\\\"<|>\\\"Ubiquitin marks proteins for degradation, which are then removed by the proteasome.\\\"<|>\\\"protein degradation, proteasome function\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"gene regulation, protein synthesis, cell cycle, cancer development, epigenetic regulation, tumor suppressors, oncogenes\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.\n\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes. In cancer cells, the DNA in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands. Histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells. This combination of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer. When these modifications occur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced. Increasingly, scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer. Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed—for example, by preventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in DNA—it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these processes. Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.\n\nGenes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge.\n\nCancer and Transcriptional Control\nAlterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. Mutations that activate transcription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding site in a promoter. This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth. Alternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor. This could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.\n\nResearchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying how a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and new ways to treat cancer. In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. One such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.\n\nCancer and Post-transcriptional Control\nChanges in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have shown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to degrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could dramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a change in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that alterations in miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.\n\nCancer and Translational/Post-translational Control\nThere are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications are found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative splice variants of a protein. An example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically different outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. The c-Flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell death pathway, comes in two forms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS). Both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell death mechanisms in normal cells. However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death. Clearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer.\n\nNew Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies\nScientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new ways to treat and prevent disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns within individual tumors. This idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of personalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the EGF protein. Undoubtedly,\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\ncancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.\\n\\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes. In cancer cells, the DNA in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands. Histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells. This combination of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer. When these modifications occur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced. Increasingly, scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer. Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed—for example, by preventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in DNA—it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these processes. Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.\\n\\nGenes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge.\\n\\nCancer and Transcriptional Control\\nAlterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. Mutations that activate transcription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding site in a promoter. This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth. Alternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor. This could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.\\n\\nResearchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying how a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and new ways to treat cancer. In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. One such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.\\n\\nCancer and Post-transcriptional Control\\nChanges in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have shown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to degrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could dramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a change in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that alterations in miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.\\n\\nCancer and Translational/Post-translational Control\\nThere are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer.

With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the EGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression changes can cause cancer.\n\nCareer Connection: Clinical Trial Coordinator\n\nA clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes coordinating patient schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. A clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing degree, or other certification. People who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator. These jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctor’s offices also conduct clinical trials and may hire a coordinator.\n\nSummary\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. Changes at every level of eukaryotic gene expression can be detected in some form of cancer at some point in time. In order to understand how changes to gene expression can cause cancer, it is critical to understand how each stage of gene regulation works in normal cells. By understanding the mechanisms of control in normal, non-diseased cells, it will be easier for scientists to understand what goes wrong in disease states including complex ones like cancer.\n\n17: Biotechnology and Genomics\n\n17.0: Introduction\nThe study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of DNA, progressed to the study of genes and small fragments, and has now exploded to the field of genomics. Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. The advances in genomics have been made possible by DNA sequencing technology.\n\nThe study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of DNA, progressed to the study of genes and small fragments, and has now exploded to the field of genomics. Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. The advances in genomics have been made possible by DNA sequencing technology. Just as information technology has led to Google maps that enable people to get detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information is used to create similar maps of the DNA of different organisms. These findings have helped anthropologists to better understand human migration and have aided the field of medicine through the mapping of human genetic diseases. The ways in which genomic information can contribute to scientific understanding are varied and quickly growing.\n\nThe left part of this image is an illustration of a gene chip. The chip is a grid comprising nine columns and 21 rows. Most cells in the grid are blue, but some are green, yellow, or red. The green, yellow, or red color shows that DNA has hybridized with the chip, indicating the presence of a particular gene. The right part of the image is a satellite image of Spain, with a small region outlined in a square. This image is meant to reinforce the concept that, like regions of the world, DNA can be mapped.\nFigure  17.0.1\n : In genomics, the DNA of different organisms is compared, enabling scientists to create maps with which to navigate the DNA of different organisms.

Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields).\n\nBiotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement. Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels (Figure 17.1.1\n).\n\nFigure_B17_01_01ab.jpg\nFigure 17.1.1\n: Antibiotics are chemicals produced by fungi, bacteria, and other organisms that have antimicrobial properties.

The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be re\n######################\nOutput:"

With an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the EGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression changes can cause cancer.\\n\\nCareer Connection: Clinical Trial Coordinator\\n\\nA clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. This job includes coordinating patient schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. A clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing degree, or other certification. People who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator. These jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctor’s offices also conduct clinical trials and may hire a coordinator.\\n\\nSummary\\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. Changes at every level of eukaryotic gene expression can be detected in some form of cancer at some point in time. In order to understand how changes to gene expression can cause cancer, it is critical to understand how each stage of gene regulation works in normal cells. By understanding the mechanisms of control in normal, non-diseased cells, it will be easier for scientists to understand what goes wrong in disease states including complex ones like cancer.\\n\\n17: Biotechnology and Genomics\\n\\n17.0: Introduction\\nThe study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of DNA, progressed to the study of genes and small fragments, and has now exploded to the field of genomics.

Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. The advances in genomics have been made possible by DNA sequencing technology. Just as information technology has led to Google maps that enable people to get detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information is used to create similar maps of the DNA of different organisms. These findings have helped anthropologists to better understand human migration and have aided the field of medicine through the mapping of human genetic diseases. The ways in which genomic information can contribute to scientific understanding are varied and quickly growing.\\n\\nThe left part of this image is an illustration of a gene chip. The chip is a grid comprising nine columns and 21 rows. Most cells in the grid are blue, but some are green, yellow, or red. The green, yellow, or red color shows that DNA has hybridized with the chip, indicating the presence of a particular gene. The right part of the image is a satellite image of Spain, with a small region outlined in a square. This image is meant to reinforce the concept that, like regions of the world, DNA can be mapped.\\nFigure  17.0.1\\n : In genomics, the DNA of different organisms is compared, enabling scientists to create maps with which to navigate the DNA of different organisms.

Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields).

The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-coding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.\n\nDNA and RNA Extraction\nTo study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (Figure 17.1.2\n). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a lysis buffer (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means “to split.” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases (RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.\n\nThis illustration shows the four main steps of DNA extraction. In the first step, cells in a test tube are lysed using a detergent that disrupts the plasma membrane. In the second step, cell contents are treated with protease to destroy protein, and RNAase to destroy RNA. The resulting slurry is centrifuged to pellet the cell debris. The supernatant, or liquid, containing the DNA is then transferred to a clean test tube. The DNA is precipitated with ethanol. It forms viscous, mucous-like strands that can be spooled on a glass rod\nFigure 17.1.2\n: This diagram shows the basic method used for extraction of DNA.\nRNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.\n\nGel Electrophoresis\nBecause nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (Figure 17.1.3\n). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.\n\nPhoto shows an agarose gel illuminated under UV light. The gel contains nine lanes from left to right. Each lane was loaded with a sample containing DNA fragments of differing size that separated as they travelled through the gel from top to bottom. The DNA appears as thin, white bands on a black background. Lanes one and nine contain many bands from a DNA standard. These bands are closely spaced toward the top, and spaced farther apart further down the gel. Lanes two through eight contain one or two bands each. Some of these bands are identical in size and run the same distance into the gel. Others run a slightly different distance, indicating a small difference in size.\nFigure 17.1.3\n: Shown are DNA fragments from seven samples run on a gel, stained with a fluorescent dye, and viewed under UV light. (credit: James Jacob, Tompkins Cortland Community College)\nAmplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction\nAlthough genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions of the genome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis (Figure 17.1.4\n). PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and the amplification of DNA for sequencing. More practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases.\n\nIllustration shows the amplification of a DNA sequence by the polymerase chain reaction. PCR consists of three steps—denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis—that occur at high, low, and intermediate temperatures. In step 1, the denaturation step, the\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nwith nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-coding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.\\n\\nDNA and RNA Extraction\\nTo study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (Figure 17.1.2\\n). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a lysis buffer (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means “to split.” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases (RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.\\n\\nThis illustration shows the four main steps of DNA extraction. In the first step, cells in a test tube are lysed using a detergent that disrupts the plasma membrane. In the second step, cell contents are treated with protease to destroy protein, and RNAase to destroy RNA. The resulting slurry is centrifuged to pellet the cell debris. The supernatant, or liquid, containing the DNA is then transferred to a clean test tube. The DNA is precipitated with ethanol. It forms viscous, mucous-like strands that can be spooled on a glass rod\\nFigure 17.1.2\\n: This diagram shows the basic method used for extraction of DNA.\\nRNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because RNAses are commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the RNA.\\n\\nGel Electrophoresis\\nBecause nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (Figure 17.1.3\\n). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.\\n\\nPhoto shows an agarose gel illuminated under UV light. The gel contains nine lanes from left to right. Each lane was loaded with a sample containing DNA fragments of differing size that separated as they travelled through the gel from top to bottom. The DNA appears as thin, white bands on a black background. Lanes one and nine contain many bands from a DNA standard. These bands are closely spaced toward the top, and spaced farther apart further down the gel. Lanes two through eight contain one or two bands each. Some of these bands are identical in size and run the same distance into the gel. Others run a slightly different distance, indicating a small difference in size.\\nFigure 17.1.3\\n: Shown are DNA fragments from seven samples run on a gel, stained with a fluorescent dye, and viewed under UV light. (credit: James Jacob, Tompkins Cortland Community College)\\nAmplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction\\nAlthough genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions of the genome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis (Figure 17.1.4\\n). PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a sample, and the amplification of DNA for sequencing. More practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases.\\n\\nIllustration shows the amplification of a DNA sequence by the polymerase chain reaction. PCR consists of three steps—denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis—that occur at high, low, and intermediate temperatures. In step 1, the denaturation step, the\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA is a type of nucleic acid molecule that contains genetic information.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"RNA is a type of nucleic acid molecule involved in gene expression.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Genome\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The genome is the complete set of DNA molecules in an organism's nucleus.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cell\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Cells are the basic structural and functional units of living organisms, containing DNA and RNA molecules.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The nucleus is the organelle in eukaryotic cells where DNA is stored.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"James Jacob\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"James Jacob is a person credited with an image of a gel electrophoresis result.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tompkins Cortland Community College\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tompkins Cortland Community College is an educational institution involved in research and teaching.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"Genome\\\"<|>\\\"The genome is comprised of DNA molecules.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic information, DNA structure\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"RNA is involved in gene expression and is complementary to DNA.\\\"<|>\\\"gene expression, nucleic acid interaction\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cell\\\"<|>\\\"Nucleus\\\"<|>\\\"The nucleus is located within a cell and contains DNA.\\\"<|>\\\"cellular structure, organelle function\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"James Jacob\\\"<|>\\\"Tompkins Cortland Community College\\\"<|>\\\"James Jacob is affiliated with Tompkins Cortland Community College.\\\"<|>\\\"academic affiliation, research institution\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DNA\\\"<|>\\\"PCR\\\"<|>\\\"PCR is a technique used to amplify specific regions of DNA.\\\"<|>\\\"DNA analysis, molecular biology technique\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"RNA\\\"<|>\\\"RNA Analysis\\\"<|>\\\"RNA analysis is used to study gene expression patterns in cells.\\\"<|>\\\"gene expression, molecular biology technique\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"nucleic acids, DNA analysis, gene expression, molecular biology, genomics\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

More practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases.\n\nIllustration shows the amplification of a DNA sequence by the polymerase chain reaction. PCR consists of three steps—denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis—that occur at high, low, and intermediate temperatures. In step 1, the denaturation step, the sample is heated to a high temperature so the DNA strands separate. In step 2, annealing, the sample is cooled so two primers can anneal to the two strands of DNA. The primers are spaced such that the sequence of interest between them will be amplified. In step 3, DNA synthesis, the sample is warmed to the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary strand from the primer to the 3' end of the molecule. This cycle is repeated again and again. Each time, the newly synthesized strands serve as templates so that the amount of DNA doubles with each cycle. As the cycles continue, more and more strands are the size of the distance between the two primers; in the end, the vast majority of strands are this size.\nFigure 17.1.4\n: Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA. Primers—short pieces of DNA complementary to each end of the target sequence—are combined with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and deoxynucleotides. Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus that is able to withstand the high temperatures used in PCR. Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA template before PCR begins.\nDNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA. This process is called reverse transcription. This requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. After the cDNA is made, regular PCR can be used to amplify it.\n\nHybridization, Southern Blotting, and Northern Blotting\nNucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts, can be probed for the presence of certain sequences. Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection. Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size. The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting (Figure  17.1.5\n ). The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences. When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called Southern blotting, and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, it is called northern blotting. Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression.\n\nIn Southern blotting, DNA is separated on the basis of size by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments run through the gel from top to bottom. In the gel shown in this figure, there are so many DNA fragments they appear as a smear in each lane.  The DNA from the gel is transferred to a nylon membrane. To do so, the gel is sandwiched between filter paper and the membrane and placed in hybridization buffer. Paper towels above the gel wick up the moisture and assist in the transfer. The nylon membrane is then incubated with a radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe that is complementary to the sequence of interest. Discrete bands appear where the sequence of interest is located.\nFigure  17.1.5\n : Southern blotting is used to find a particular sequence in a sample of DNA. DNA fragments are separated on a gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with a DNA probe complementary to the sequence of interest. Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting, but RNA is run on the gel instead of DNA. In western blotting, proteins are run on a gel and detected using antibodies.\nMolecular Cloning\nIn general, the word “cloning” means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.\n\nCloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products), or noncoding regions in isolation. A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a \"folder\" in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.\n\nPlasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such\n######################\nOutput:"

amplification of DNA for sequencing. More practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases.\\n\\nIllustration shows the amplification of a DNA sequence by the polymerase chain reaction. PCR consists of three steps—denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis—that occur at high, low, and intermediate temperatures. In step 1, the denaturation step, the sample is heated to a high temperature so the DNA strands separate. In step 2, annealing, the sample is cooled so two primers can anneal to the two strands of DNA. The primers are spaced such that the sequence of interest between them will be amplified. In step 3, DNA synthesis, the sample is warmed to the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary strand from the primer to the 3' end of the molecule. This cycle is repeated again and again. Each time, the newly synthesized strands serve as templates so that the amount of DNA doubles with each cycle. As the cycles continue, more and more strands are the size of the distance between the two primers; in the end, the vast majority of strands are this size.\\nFigure 17.1.4\\n: Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA. Primers—short pieces of DNA complementary to each end of the target sequence—are combined with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and deoxynucleotides. Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus aquaticus that is able to withstand the high temperatures used in PCR. Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA template before PCR begins.\\nDNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA. This process is called reverse transcription. This requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. After the cDNA is made, regular PCR can be used to amplify it.\\n\\nHybridization, Southern Blotting, and Northern Blotting\\nNucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts, can be probed for the presence of certain sequences. Short DNA fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection. Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size. The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting (Figure  17.1.5\\n ). The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences. When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called Southern blotting, and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, it is called northern blotting. Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression.\\n\\nIn Southern blotting, DNA is separated on the basis of size by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments run through the gel from top to bottom. In the gel shown in this figure, there are so many DNA fragments they appear as a smear in each lane.  The DNA from the gel is transferred to a nylon membrane. To do so, the gel is sandwiched between filter paper and the membrane and placed in hybridization buffer. Paper towels above the gel wick up the moisture and assist in the transfer. The nylon membrane is then incubated with a radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe that is complementary to the sequence of interest. Discrete bands appear where the sequence of interest is located.\\nFigure  17.1.5\\n : Southern blotting is used to find a particular sequence in a sample of DNA. DNA fragments are separated on a gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with a DNA probe complementary to the sequence of interest. Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting, but RNA is run on the gel instead of DNA. In western blotting, proteins are run on a gel and detected using antibodies.\\nMolecular Cloning\\nIn general, the word “cloning” means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.\\n\\nCloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products), or noncoding regions in isolation. A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a \\\"folder\\\" in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.\\n\\nPlasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Thermus aquaticus\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Thermus aquaticus is a thermostable bacterium isolated from the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Yellowstone National Park\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Yellowstone National Park is a location where Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"PCR\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a laboratory technique used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Taq polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase isolated from Thermus aquaticus that is able to withstand high temperatures used in PCR.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"RT-PCR is a laboratory technique used to amplify a specific sequence of DNA from an RNA template.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Southern Blotting\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Southern blotting is a laboratory technique used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Northern Blotting\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Northern blotting is a laboratory technique used to detect gene expression.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Western Blotting\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Western blotting is a laboratory technique used to detect proteins.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular Cloning\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular cloning is a laboratory technique used to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli is a bacterium that can host plasmids for molecular cloning.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Thermus aquaticus\\\"<|>\\\"Yellowstone National Park\\\"<|>\\\"Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park.\\\"<|>\\\"habitat, location\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"PCR\\\"<|>\\\"Taq polymerase\\\"<|>\\\"Taq polymerase is used in PCR to synthesize the complementary strand from the primer to the 3' end of the molecule.\\\"<|>\\\"laboratory technique, enzyme catalysis\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)\\\"<|>\\\"PCR\\\"<|>\\\"RT-PCR is a variation of PCR that amplifies a specific sequence of DNA from an RNA template.\\\"<|>\\\"laboratory technique, RNA template\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Southern Blotting\\\"<|>\\\"PCR\\\"<|>\\\"Southern blotting is used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome, which can be amplified by PCR.\\\"<|>\\\"laboratory technique, DNA detection\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular Cloning\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli can host plasmids for molecular cloning.\\\"<|>\\\"bacterial host, genetic engineering\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"molecular biology, laboratory techniques, genetics, genome analysis\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site (MCS). The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called “sticky ends.” Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure  17.1.6\n ).\n\nRecombinant DNA Molecules\nPlasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.\n\nArt Connection\n\nFigure illustrates the steps in molecular cloning into a plasmid called a cloning vector. The vector has a lacZ gene, which is necessary for metabolizing lactose, and a gene for ampicillin resistance. Within the lacZ gene are restriction sites, sequences of DNA cut by a particular restriction enzyme. The DNA to be cloned and the plasmid are both cut by the same restriction enzyme. The restriction enzyme staggers the cuts on the two strands of DNA, such that each strand has an overhanging single-stranded bit of DNA. On one strand, the sequence of the overhang is GATC, and on the other, the sequence is CTAG. These two sequences are complementary, and allow the fragment of foreign DNA to anneal with the plasmid. An enzyme called ligase joins the two pieces together. The ligated plasmid is then transformed into a bacterial strain that lacks the lacZ gene and is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The bacteria are plated on media containing ampicillin, so that only bacteria that have taken up the plasmid (which has an ampicillin resistance gene) will grow. The media also contains X-gal, a chemical that is metabolized in the same way as lactose. Plasmids lacking the insert are able to metabolize X-gal, releasing a dye from X-gal that turns the colony blue. Plasmids with the insert have a disrupted lacZ gene and produce white colonies. Thus, colonies containing the cloned DNA can be selected on the basis of color.\nFigure  17.1.6\n : This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.\nYou are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded by nucleases, but still used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect from your molecular cloning experiment?\n\nThere will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.\nThere will be blue colonies only.\nThere will be blue and white colonies.\nThe will be white colonies only.\n\nCellular Cloning\nUnicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact replica of the genetic material.\n\nReproductive Cloning\nReproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.\n\nParthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.\n\nSexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nstudied) is referred to as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.\\n\\nPlasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site (MCS). The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called “sticky ends.” Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (Figure  17.1.6\\n ).\\n\\nRecombinant DNA Molecules\\nPlasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.\\n\\nArt Connection\\n\\nFigure illustrates the steps in molecular cloning into a plasmid called a cloning vector. The vector has a lacZ gene, which is necessary for metabolizing lactose, and a gene for ampicillin resistance. Within the lacZ gene are restriction sites, sequences of DNA cut by a particular restriction enzyme. The DNA to be cloned and the plasmid are both cut by the same restriction enzyme. The restriction enzyme staggers the cuts on the two strands of DNA, such that each strand has an overhanging single-stranded bit of DNA. On one strand, the sequence of the overhang is GATC, and on the other, the sequence is CTAG. These two sequences are complementary, and allow the fragment of foreign DNA to anneal with the plasmid. An enzyme called ligase joins the two pieces together. The ligated plasmid is then transformed into a bacterial strain that lacks the lacZ gene and is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The bacteria are plated on media containing ampicillin, so that only bacteria that have taken up the plasmid (which has an ampicillin resistance gene) will grow. The media also contains X-gal, a chemical that is metabolized in the same way as lactose. Plasmids lacking the insert are able to metabolize X-gal, releasing a dye from X-gal that turns the colony blue. Plasmids with the insert have a disrupted lacZ gene and produce white colonies. Thus, colonies containing the cloned DNA can be selected on the basis of color.\\nFigure  17.1.6\\n : This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.\\nYou are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded by nucleases, but still used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect from your molecular cloning experiment?\\n\\nThere will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.\\nThere will be blue colonies only.\\nThere will be blue and white colonies.\\nThe will be white colonies only.\\n\\nCellular Cloning\\nUnicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact replica of the genetic material.\\n\\nReproductive Cloning\\nReproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.\\n\\nParthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.\\n\\nSexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli is a bacterial species that is commonly used in molecular biology research.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"plasmid vectors\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Plasmid vectors are molecules used for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"molecular cloning\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular cloning is a laboratory technique used to create recombinant DNA molecules.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"insulin\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and used to treat diabetes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"human growth hormone\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Human growth hormone is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and used to treat growth disorders.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DNA ligase\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DNA ligase is an enzyme used to join DNA fragments together.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"restriction endonucleases\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Restriction endonucleases are enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"lacZ gene\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The lacZ gene is a gene necessary for metabolizing lactose.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ampicillin resistance gene\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The ampicillin resistance gene is a gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"X-gal\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"X-gal is a chemical used to select for bacteria that have taken up a plasmid with an insert.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli\\\"<|>\\\"plasmid vectors\\\"<|>\\\"Plasmid vectors are often used in Escherichia coli for molecular cloning.\\\"<|>\\\"molecular biology, gene expression\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"molecular cloning\\\"<|>\\\"plasmid vectors\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular cloning involves the use of plasmid vectors to create recombinant DNA molecules.\\\"<|>\\\"laboratory technique, molecular biology\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"insulin\\\"<|>\\\"molecular cloning\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular cloning is used to produce insulin on a large scale.\\\"<|>\\\"biotechnology, medical applications\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"human growth hormone\\\"<|>\\\"molecular cloning\\\"<|>\\\"Molecular cloning is used to produce human growth hormone on a large scale.\\\"<|>\\\"biotechnology, medical applications\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"molecular biology, gene expression, biotechnology, genetic engineering\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.\n\nSexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.\n\nThe first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.1.7). There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). Still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.\n\nArt Connection\n\nTo clone Dolly the sheep, a Scottish Blackface sheep was used as a cytoplasmic donor. Eggs from this sheep were extracted, and the nucleus removed. A Finn-Dorset sheep was used as the nuclear donor. Nuclei were extracted from mammary cells, and direct electric current was used to fuse the nuclear DNA with the donor egg. The egg was then allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage, in which a sphere of cells contains a cluster of cells on one side. The blastocyst was implanted in a surrogate mother, resulting in Dolly the sheep.\nFigure  17.1.7\n : Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned. To create Dolly, the nucleus was removed from a donor egg cell. The nucleus from a second sheep was then introduced into the cell, which was allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage before being implanted in a surrogate mother. (credit: modification of work by \"Squidonius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\nDo you think Dolly was a Finn-Dorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep?\n\nGenetic Engineering\nGenetic engineering is the alteration of an organism’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s DNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.\n\nGene Targeting\nAlthough classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: \"What does this gene or DNA element do?\" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology. This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting. Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism.\n\nBiotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture\nIt is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to treat the disease. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve both crop yield and quality.\n\nGenetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy\nThe process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.\\n\\nSexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.\\n\\nThe first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.1.7). There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). Still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.\\n\\nArt Connection\\n\\nTo clone Dolly the sheep, a Scottish Blackface sheep was used as a cytoplasmic donor. Eggs from this sheep were extracted, and the nucleus removed. A Finn-Dorset sheep was used as the nuclear donor. Nuclei were extracted from mammary cells, and direct electric current was used to fuse the nuclear DNA with the donor egg. The egg was then allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage, in which a sphere of cells contains a cluster of cells on one side. The blastocyst was implanted in a surrogate mother, resulting in Dolly the sheep.\\nFigure  17.1.7\\n : Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned. To create Dolly, the nucleus was removed from a donor egg cell. The nucleus from a second sheep was then introduced into the cell, which was allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage before being implanted in a surrogate mother. (credit: modification of work by \\\"Squidonius\\\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nDo you think Dolly was a Finn-Dorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep?\\n\\nGenetic Engineering\\nGenetic engineering is the alteration of an organism’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s DNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.\\n\\nGene Targeting\\nAlthough classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: \\\"What does this gene or DNA element do?\\\" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology. This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting. Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism.\\n\\nBiotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture\\nIt is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to treat the disease. Biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve both crop yield and quality.\\n\\nGenetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy\\nThe process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly is a sheep who was the first mammal to be cloned, born in 1996.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Finn-Dorset sheep\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Finn-Dorset is a breed of sheep used as a nuclear donor in Dolly's cloning process.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Scottish Blackface sheep\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Scottish Blackface is a breed of sheep used as a cytoplasmic donor in Dolly's cloning process.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Engineering\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Engineering is the alteration of an organism's genotype using recombinant DNA technology to achieve desirable traits.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Targeting\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Biotechnology\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Biotechnology is the use of biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products for specific use.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Reproductive Cloning\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Reproductive Cloning is a technique used to produce a genetically identical copy of an organism.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Therapeutic Cloning\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Therapeutic Cloning is a technique used to produce embryonic stem cells for the purpose of treating diseases or defects.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly\\\"<|>\\\"Finn-Dorset sheep\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly was cloned using a Finn-Dorset sheep as a nuclear donor.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic donor, cloning process\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly\\\"<|>\\\"Scottish Blackface sheep\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly was cloned using a Scottish Blackface sheep as a cytoplasmic donor.\\\"<|>\\\"cytoplasmic donor, cloning process\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Engineering\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Targeting\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Targeting is a technique used in Genetic Engineering to alter the expression of a particular gene.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic modification, gene expression\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Biotechnology\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Engineering\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Engineering is a subfield of Biotechnology that involves the alteration of an organism's genotype.\\\"<|>\\\"biotechnology application, genetic modification\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Reproductive Cloning\\\"<|>\\\"Therapeutic Cloning\\\"<|>\\\"Therapeutic Cloning is a type of cloning that produces embryonic stem cells, differing from Reproductive Cloning which aims to reproduce an organism.\\\"<|>\\\"cloning types, stem cells\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"cloning, genetic engineering, biotechnology, gene targeting, reproductive cloning, therapeutic cloning\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.\n\nGene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA (Figure  17.1.8\n ). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\n\nTo cure disease using an adenovirus vector, a new gene intended to replace a defective one is packaged with the adenovirus genome. The genes that make the virus pathogenic are removed. The modified DNA is put inside the virus’ capsid, or protein coat. The person to be cured is infected with the modified virus. Viral DNA enters the nucleus, where the modified gene can replace the defective one.\nFigure  17.1.8\n : Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to cure certain genetic diseases in which a person has a defective gene. (credit: NIH)\nProduction of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones\nTraditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response. Modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. The antigen is then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. Genes cloned from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.\n\nAntibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells.\n\nRecombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of differences in the gene product. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children. The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.\n\nTransgenic Animals\nAlthough several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic animals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens. Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.\n\nTransgenic Plants\nManipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure  17.1.9\n ). Plants are the most important source of food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-day biotechnology practices were established.\n\nPhoto shows corn cobs with different colors, including yellow, white, red, and a mixture of these colors.\nFigure  17.1.9\n : Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through plant biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)\nPlants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called transgenic plants. Because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically engineered.\n\nTransformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens\nGene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens occur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are affected by A. tumefaciens. The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall.\n\nResearchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell’s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nof a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.\\n\\nGene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA (Figure  17.1.8\\n ). More advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).\\n\\nTo cure disease using an adenovirus vector, a new gene intended to replace a defective one is packaged with the adenovirus genome. The genes that make the virus pathogenic are removed. The modified DNA is put inside the virus’ capsid, or protein coat. The person to be cured is infected with the modified virus. Viral DNA enters the nucleus, where the modified gene can replace the defective one.\\nFigure  17.1.8\\n : Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to cure certain genetic diseases in which a person has a defective gene. (credit: NIH)\\nProduction of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones\\nTraditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response. Modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. The antigen is then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. Genes cloned from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus.\\n\\nAntibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells.\\n\\nRecombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of differences in the gene product. In addition, human growth hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children. The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector.\\n\\nTransgenic Animals\\nAlthough several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic animals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens. Mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations.\\n\\nTransgenic Plants\\nManipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life (Figure  17.1.9\\n ). Plants are the most important source of food for the human population. Farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-day biotechnology practices were established.\\n\\nPhoto shows corn cobs with different colors, including yellow, white, red, and a mixture of these colors.\\nFigure  17.1.9\\n : Corn, a major agricultural crop used to create products for a variety of industries, is often modified through plant biotechnology. (credit: Keith Weller, USDA)\\nPlants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called transgenic plants. Because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically engineered.\\n\\nTransformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens\\nGene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens occur by transfer of DNA from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are affected by A. tumefaciens. The artificial introduction of DNA into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall.\\n\\nResearchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell’s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"NIH\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a government agency involved in medical research and providing credits for images.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"breast cancer patients\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Breast cancer patients are individuals diagnosed with breast cancer, often advised to undergo genetic testing and biopsy.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"families with genetic diseases\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Families with genetic diseases are those affected by inherited gene mutations, often advised to undergo genetic testing and screening.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"medical team\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"The medical team consists of healthcare professionals involved in diagnosing and treating diseases, such as breast cancer, and determining genetic basis of cancer development.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"women with breast cancer risk\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Women with breast cancer risk are those with a higher likelihood of developing breast cancer due to inherited gene mutations.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"fetal genetic testing\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Fetal genetic testing is a medical procedure used to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in fetuses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"in vitro fertilization\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"In vitro fertilization is a reproductive technology used to conceive embryos outside the human body.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Therapy\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Gene therapy is a medical technique used to cure diseases caused by genetic mutations.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"adenovirus vector\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Adenovirus vector is a type of viral vector used in gene therapy to deliver healthy genes into diseased cells.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"breast cancer patients\\\"<|>\\\"medical team\\\"<|>\\\"Breast cancer patients work with a medical team to diagnose and treat breast cancer, including genetic testing and biopsy.\\\"<|>\\\"medical treatment, patient care\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"families with genetic diseases\\\"<|>\\\"genetic testing\\\"<|>\\\"Families with genetic diseases undergo genetic testing to identify inherited gene mutations.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic diagnosis, family history\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Gene Therapy\\\"<|>\\\"adenovirus vector\\\"<|>\\\"Gene therapy uses adenovirus vectors to deliver healthy genes into diseased cells.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic engineering, medical treatment\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"NIH\\\"<|>\\\"genetic diseases\\\"<|>\\\"The NIH is involved in research on genetic diseases and provides resources for genetic testing and therapy.\\\"<|>\\\"medical research, genetic disease management\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"genetic testing, gene therapy, biotechnology, medical research, genetic diseases\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell’s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and can be propagated in E. coli cells as well.\n\nThe Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis\nBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants. Bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.\n\nFlavr Savr Tomato\nThe first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato produced in 1994. Antisense RNA technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato. The Flavr Savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop.\n\nSummary\nNucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and enzymatically destroying all other major macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA or RNA can be amplified by PCR. Southern and northern blotting can be used to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample. The term “cloning” may refer to cloning small DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an inheritable disease.\n\nTransgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic plants are usually created to improve characteristics of crop plants.\n\nArt Connections\nFigure  17.1.6\n : You are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded by nucleases, but still used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect from your molecular cloning experiment?\n\nThere will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.\nThere will be blue colonies only.\nThere will be blue and white colonies.\nThe will be white colonies only.\nAnswer\nB. The experiment would result in blue colonies only.\n\nFigure  17.1.7\n : Do you think Dolly was a Finn-Dorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep?\n\nAnswer\nDolly was a Finn-Dorset sheep because even though the original cell came from a Scottish blackface sheep and the surrogate mother was a Scottish blackface, the DNA came from a Finn-Dorset.\n\n17.2: Mapping Genomes\nGenome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture and use genetic markers. A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait.\n\nGenomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis. Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.\n\nGenetic Maps\nThe study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nthe natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell’s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and can be propagated in E. coli cells as well.\\n\\nThe Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis\\nBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants. Bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. Insects that have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. The crystal toxin genes have been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.\\n\\nFlavr Savr Tomato\\nThe first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the Flavr Savr Tomato produced in 1994. Antisense RNA technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato. The Flavr Savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop.\\n\\nSummary\\nNucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and enzymatically destroying all other major macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA or RNA can be amplified by PCR. Southern and northern blotting can be used to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample. The term “cloning” may refer to cloning small DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an inheritable disease.\\n\\nTransgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA technology. Transgenic plants are usually created to improve characteristics of crop plants.\\n\\nArt Connections\\nFigure  17.1.6\\n : You are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded by nucleases, but still used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect from your molecular cloning experiment?\\n\\nThere will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.\\nThere will be blue colonies only.\\nThere will be blue and white colonies.\\nThe will be white colonies only.\\nAnswer\\nB. The experiment would result in blue colonies only.\\n\\nFigure  17.1.7\\n : Do you think Dolly was a Finn-Dorset or a Scottish Blackface sheep?\\n\\nAnswer\\nDolly was a Finn-Dorset sheep because even though the original cell came from a Scottish blackface sheep and the surrogate mother was a Scottish blackface, the DNA came from a Finn-Dorset.\\n\\n17.2: Mapping Genomes\\nGenome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture and use genetic markers. A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait.\\n\\nGenomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis. Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.\\n\\nGenetic Maps\\nThe study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Agrobacterium\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Agrobacterium is a bacterium that can transfer DNA to plants, and its plasmids can be manipulated for genetic modification.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Bacillus thuringiensis\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Bacillus thuringiensis is a bacterium that produces protein crystals toxic to insects, and its genes have been used in genetically modified crops.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Flavr Savr Tomato\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Flavr Savr Tomato is a genetically modified crop that was introduced to the market in 1994 with improved shelf life and flavor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is a bacterium used in molecular biology for propagating plasmids.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly is a sheep that was cloned using genetic material from a Finn-Dorset sheep.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Agrobacterium\\\"<|>\\\"Ti plasmids\\\"<|>\\\"Agrobacterium contains Ti plasmids that can be manipulated for genetic modification.\\\"<|>\\\"bacterial plasmids, genetic modification\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Bacillus thuringiensis\\\"<|>\\\"Bt toxin\\\"<|>\\\"Bacillus thuringiensis produces Bt toxin that is toxic to insects.\\\"<|>\\\"insecticide, gene expression\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Flavr Savr Tomato\\\"<|>\\\"antisense RNA technology\\\"<|>\\\"Flavr Savr Tomato was developed using antisense RNA technology to improve its shelf life and flavor.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic modification, food technology\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly\\\"<|>\\\"Finn-Dorset sheep\\\"<|>\\\"Dolly was cloned using genetic material from a Finn-Dorset sheep.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic cloning, animal reproduction\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli\\\"<|>\\\"Ti plasmids\\\"<|>\\\"E. coli is used to propagate Ti plasmids.\\\"<|>\\\"bacterial propagation, molecular biology\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"genetic modification, biotechnology, molecular biology, genome mapping, genomics\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.\n\nGenetic Maps\nThe study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA. Early geneticists relied on the observation of phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism. Shortly after Gregor Mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what are now known as genes, other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by being located on the same chromosome. The mapping of genes relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps.\n\nObservations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of crosses between parents with different traits. For example, in experiments performed on the garden pea, it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant’s pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome. The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA, such as nonsister chromatids. Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes. The greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher the recombination frequency between them. Two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis are shown in Figure 17.2.1\n. If the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50 percent, they are said to be linked.\n\nA homologous pair of chromosomes has three genes, named A, B, and C. Gene A is located near the top of the chromosome, and genes B and C are located close together near the bottom. Each chromosome has different A, B, and C alleles. The alleles may recombine if a crossover occurs between them, so that genetic material from one chromosome is swapped with another. Genes A and B are far apart on the chromosome such that a crossover event occurring almost anywhere in the chromosome will result in the recombination of alleles for these genes. Genes B and C are much closer together, so only crossovers occurring in a very narrow region will result in recombination of these genes.\nFigure 17.2.1\n: Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome. Recombination between genes A and B is more frequent than recombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart; a crossover is therefore more likely to occur between them.\nThe generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains). Early genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers. More sophisticated markers, including those based on non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population. Although individuals of a given species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in the genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping. In general, a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.\n\nSome genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RFLPs (sometimes pronounced “rif-lips”) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The DNA of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individual’s DNA “fingerprint.” Certain regions of the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA. Non-coding, or “junk,” DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in individual organisms of a population. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.\n\nBecause genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases or decreases in the level of recombination in any given area of the genome. Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by multiple methods.\n\nPhysical Maps\nA physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides. There are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome. It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nstudy individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change.\\n\\nGenetic Maps\\nThe study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA. Early geneticists relied on the observation of phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism. Shortly after Gregor Mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what are now known as genes, other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by being located on the same chromosome. The mapping of genes relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps.\\n\\nObservations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of crosses between parents with different traits. For example, in experiments performed on the garden pea, it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant’s pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome. The exchange of DNA between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between homologous strands of DNA, such as nonsister chromatids. Linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes. The greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher the recombination frequency between them. Two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis are shown in Figure 17.2.1\\n. If the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50 percent, they are said to be linked.\\n\\nA homologous pair of chromosomes has three genes, named A, B, and C. Gene A is located near the top of the chromosome, and genes B and C are located close together near the bottom. Each chromosome has different A, B, and C alleles. The alleles may recombine if a crossover occurs between them, so that genetic material from one chromosome is swapped with another. Genes A and B are far apart on the chromosome such that a crossover event occurring almost anywhere in the chromosome will result in the recombination of alleles for these genes. Genes B and C are much closer together, so only crossovers occurring in a very narrow region will result in recombination of these genes.\\nFigure 17.2.1\\n: Crossover may occur at different locations on the chromosome. Recombination between genes A and B is more frequent than recombination between genes B and C because genes A and B are farther apart; a crossover is therefore more likely to occur between them.\\nThe generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains). Early genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers. More sophisticated markers, including those based on non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population. Although individuals of a given species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits. These minor differences in the genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping. In general, a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.\\n\\nSome genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RFLPs (sometimes pronounced “rif-lips”) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The DNA of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individual’s DNA “fingerprint.” Certain regions of the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA. Non-coding, or “junk,” DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows that much of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in individual organisms of a population. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.\\n\\nBecause genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases or decreases in the level of recombination in any given area of the genome. Some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by multiple methods.\\n\\nPhysical Maps\\nA physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides. There are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome. It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output based on the provided text and entity types:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Maps\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Human genome maps are used to identify disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gregor Mendel\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Gregor Mendel is the father of modern genetics, known for proposing that traits are determined by genes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Garden Pea\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The garden pea is a plant used in genetic experiments to study inheritance of traits.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"National Institute of Health\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The National Institute of Health is a research organization involved in genetic research and mapping.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Maps\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic maps are used to identify the location of genes on a chromosome based on linkage analysis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Maps\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Maps\\\"<|>\\\"Human genome maps rely on genetic maps to identify disease-causing genes.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic research, disease understanding\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Gregor Mendel\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Maps\\\"<|>\\\"Gregor Mendel's work on genetics laid the foundation for the development of genetic maps.\\\"<|>\\\"genetic inheritance, scientific discovery\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Garden Pea\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Maps\\\"<|>\\\"The garden pea is a plant used in genetic experiments to study inheritance of traits, contributing to the development of genetic maps.\\\"<|>\\\"plant genetics, inheritance\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"National Institute of Health\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Maps\\\"<|>\\\"The National Institute of Health is involved in genetic research and mapping, utilizing genetic maps in their work.\\\"<|>\\\"research organization, genetic mapping\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"genetics, genome mapping, disease research, plant genetics\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

There are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome. It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping, but not the exact distance (number of base pairs). Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to break the DNA into fragments. The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments. This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency. Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs. The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome) has sped up the process of physical mapping. A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or STS) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location. An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common STSs. An EST is a short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries, while SSLPs are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps.\n\nCytogenetic maps of the 22 human autosomes and the X and Y chromosomes are shown. The map appears as a black, white, and gray banding pattern unique to each chromosome.\nFigure 17.2.2\n: A cytogenetic map shows the appearance of a chromosome after it is stained and examined under a microscope. (credit: National Human Genome Research Institute)\nIntegration of Genetic and Physical Maps\nGenetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details. It is easy to understand why both types of genome mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each technique is used in combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is being used with different model organisms that are used for research. Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are expected. Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data. Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases, such as GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Efforts are being made to make the information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public. Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI has created a genome viewer tool to simplify the data-mining process.\n\nScientific Method Connection: How to Use a Genome Map Viewer\n\nProblem statement: Do the human, macaque, and mouse genomes contain common DNA sequences?\n\nDevelop a hypothesis.\n\nTo test the hypothesis, click here.\n\nIn Search box on the left panel, type any gene name or phenotypic characteristic, such as iris pigmentation (eye color). Select the species you want to study, and then press Enter. The genome map viewer will indicate which chromosome encodes the gene in your search. Click each hit in the genome viewer for more detailed information. This type of search is the most basic use of the genome viewer; it can also be used to compare sequences between species, as well as many other complicated tasks.\n\nIs the hypothesis correct? Why or why not?\n\nLink to Learning\n\nOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a searchable online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders. This website shows genome mapping information, and also details the history and research of each trait and disorder. Click this link to search for traits (such as handedness) and genetic disorders (such as diabetes).\n\nSummary\nGenome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with pieces of information coming from laboratories all over the world. Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of recombination frequencies during meiosis. Physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. The most detailed information is available through sequence mapping. Information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.\n\n17.3: Whole-Genome Sequencing\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem. Whole-genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease.\n\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem. Whole-genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genomes.\n\nFor example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death).

It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping, but not the exact distance (number of base pairs). Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to break the DNA into fragments. The amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments. This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency. Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs. The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome) has sped up the process of physical mapping. A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or STS) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location. An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common STSs. An EST is a short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries, while SSLPs are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps.\\n\\nCytogenetic maps of the 22 human autosomes and the X and Y chromosomes are shown. The map appears as a black, white, and gray banding pattern unique to each chromosome.\\nFigure 17.2.2\\n: A cytogenetic map shows the appearance of a chromosome after it is stained and examined under a microscope. (credit: National Human Genome Research Institute)\\nIntegration of Genetic and Physical Maps\\nGenetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details. It is easy to understand why both types of genome mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each technique is used in combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is being used with different model organisms that are used for research. Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are expected. Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data. Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases, such as GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Efforts are being made to make the information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public. Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI has created a genome viewer tool to simplify the data-mining process.\\n\\nScientific Method Connection: How to Use a Genome Map Viewer\\n\\nProblem statement: Do the human, macaque, and mouse genomes contain common DNA sequences?\\n\\nDevelop a hypothesis.\\n\\nTo test the hypothesis, click here.\\n\\nIn Search box on the left panel, type any gene name or phenotypic characteristic, such as iris pigmentation (eye color).

Click each hit in the genome viewer for more detailed information. This type of search is the most basic use of the genome viewer; it can also be used to compare sequences between species, as well as many other complicated tasks.\\n\\nIs the hypothesis correct?

Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of recombination frequencies during meiosis. Physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. The most detailed information is available through sequence mapping. Information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.\\n\\n17.3: Whole-Genome Sequencing\\nAlthough there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem.

In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing. Today, human genome sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two for about $1000.\n\nStrategies Used in Sequencing Projects\nThe basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (–OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (Figure  17.3.1\n ).\n\nA deoxynucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a base, and three phosphate groups. Dideoxyribose is identical to deoxyribose except that the hydroxyl (–OH) group at the 3' position is replaced by H. A 3' hydroxyl is necessary for elongation of the DNA chain, and the chain therefore stops growing if a dideoxyribose instead of deoxyribose is incorporated into the growing chain.\nFigure  17.3.1\n : A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group (indicated by the box). When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.\nEach ddNTP is labeled with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during replication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (Figure  17.3.2\n ).\n\nThe left part of this illustration shows a parent strand of DNA with the sequence GATTCAGC, and four daughter strands, each of which was made in the presence of a different dideoxynucleotide: ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, or ddTTP. The growing chain terminates when a ddNTP is incorporated, resulting in daughter strands of different lengths. The right part of this image shows the separation of the DNA fragments on the basis of size. Each ddNTP is fluorescently labeled with a different color so that the sequence can be read by the size of each fragment and its color. \nFigure  17.3.2\n : Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method is illustrated. Using dideoxynucleotides, the DNA fragment can be terminated at different points. The DNA is separated on the basis of size, and these bands, based on the size of the fragments, can be read.\nEarly Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing\nIn shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain-sequencing method. Then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences overlap. By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire DNA sequence can be reformed. A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy, consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear. The person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy. The person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller pieces you see a mountain. In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.\n\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nexample, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing. Today, human genome sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two for about $1000.\\n\\nStrategies Used in Sequencing Projects\\nThe basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (–OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (Figure  17.3.1\\n ).\\n\\nA deoxynucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a base, and three phosphate groups. Dideoxyribose is identical to deoxyribose except that the hydroxyl (–OH) group at the 3' position is replaced by H. A 3' hydroxyl is necessary for elongation of the DNA chain, and the chain therefore stops growing if a dideoxyribose instead of deoxyribose is incorporated into the growing chain.\\nFigure  17.3.1\\n : A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3' hydroxyl group (indicated by the box). When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.\\nEach ddNTP is labeled with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during replication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (Figure  17.3.2\\n ).\\n\\nThe left part of this illustration shows a parent strand of DNA with the sequence GATTCAGC, and four daughter strands, each of which was made in the presence of a different dideoxynucleotide: ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, or ddTTP. The growing chain terminates when a ddNTP is incorporated, resulting in daughter strands of different lengths. The right part of this image shows the separation of the DNA fragments on the basis of size. Each ddNTP is fluorescently labeled with a different color so that the sequence can be read by the size of each fragment and its color. \\nFigure  17.3.2\\n : Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method is illustrated. Using dideoxynucleotides, the DNA fragment can be terminated at different points. The DNA is separated on the basis of size, and these bands, based on the size of the fragments, can be read.\\nEarly Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing\\nIn shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain-sequencing method. Then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences overlap. By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire DNA sequence can be reformed. A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy, consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear. The person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy. The person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller pieces you see a mountain. In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.\\n\\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger is a scientist who developed the chain termination method for DNA sequencing in the 1970s.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Sequencing is a field of study that involves the determination of the complete DNA sequence of the human genome.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Whole-Exome Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Whole-Exome Sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing that focuses on the coding regions of the DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Apoptosis\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that is crucial for human health.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Bone-Marrow Transplant\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Bone-Marrow Transplant is a medical treatment used to cure genetic disorders.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"National Institutes of Health\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The National Institutes of Health is a leading organization in the field of genomics and genome sequencing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"Chain Termination Method\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger developed the chain termination method for DNA sequencing.\\\"<|>\\\"scientific contribution, DNA sequencing\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Whole-Exome Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Disorder\\\"<|>\\\"Whole-exome sequencing was used to diagnose and cure a genetic disorder in a young boy.\\\"<|>\\\"medical application, diagnosis\\\"><|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Apoptosis\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Disorder\\\"<|>\\\"A defect in the apoptosis pathway led to a genetic disorder in the boy.\\\"<|>\\\"biological process, disease mechanism\\\"><|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Bone-Marrow Transplant\\\"<|>\\\"Genetic Disorder\\\"<|>\\\"A bone-marrow transplant was used to cure the genetic disorder in the boy.\\\"<|>\\\"medical treatment, disease cure\\\"><|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"genomics, DNA sequencing, genetic disorders, medical applications, scientific contributions\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.\n\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double-barrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap. Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information.\n\nNext-generation Sequencing\nSince 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.\n\nEvolution Connection: Comparing Sequences\n\nA sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures. Sequence alignments may be used to construct phylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool).\n\nUnder “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.” Input the following sequence into the large \"query sequence\" box: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the \"Species\" field and type \"human\" or \"Homo sapiens\". Then click “BLAST” to compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome. The result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on \"Graphics\". This will bring you to a page that shows where the sequence is found within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected sequence by clicking the \"ATG\" button.\n\nUse of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms\nThe first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was accomplished by Fred Sanger using shotgun sequencing. Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced. The first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae; this was accomplished by Craig Venter in the 1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been sequenced. By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and humans Homo sapiens are now known. A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms. A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation. Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets.\n\nUses of Genome Sequences\nDNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences. Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays, whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome. Although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to dwell on abnormal gene function. Knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about lifestyle, medication, and having children. Genomics is still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.\n\nIn addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the development of novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel, which results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer. This knowledge should allow better methods of control over the microbes that are used in the production of biofuels. Genomics could also improve the methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants. Genomics has allowed for the development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture.\n\nIt sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to use this knowledge wisely. Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns. This information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy.\n\nSummary\nWhole-genome sequencing is the latest available\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nis a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.\\n\\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double-barrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap. Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information.\\n\\nNext-generation Sequencing\\nSince 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.\\n\\nEvolution Connection: Comparing Sequences\\n\\nA sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures. Sequence alignments may be used to construct phylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool).\\n\\nUnder “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.” Input the following sequence into the large \\\"query sequence\\\" box: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the \\\"Species\\\" field and type \\\"human\\\" or \\\"Homo sapiens\\\". Then click “BLAST” to compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome. The result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on \\\"Graphics\\\". This will bring you to a page that shows where the sequence is found within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected sequence by clicking the \\\"ATG\\\" button.\\n\\nUse of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms\\nThe first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was accomplished by Fred Sanger using shotgun sequencing. Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced. The first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae; this was accomplished by Craig Venter in the 1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been sequenced. By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and humans Homo sapiens are now known. A lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms. A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation. Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA targets.\\n\\nUses of Genome Sequences\\nDNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences. Almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays, whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome. Although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to dwell on abnormal gene function. Knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about lifestyle, medication, and having children. Genomics is still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.\\n\\nIn addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the development of novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel, which results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer. This knowledge should allow better methods of control over the microbes that are used in the production of biofuels. Genomics could also improve the methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants. Genomics has allowed for the development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture.\\n\\nIt sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to use this knowledge wisely. Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns. This information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy.\\n\\nSummary\\nWhole-genome sequencing is the latest available\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output based on the provided text and entity types:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger is a scientist who accomplished the first genome sequencing of a bacterial virus using shotgun sequencing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Craig Venter\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Craig Venter is a scientist who accomplished the first genome sequencing of an organism, the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Haemophilus influenzae\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium whose genome was first sequenced by Craig Venter.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast whose genome was sequenced by a collaboration of 74 laboratories.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli K12\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Escherichia coli K12 is a bacterium whose genome sequence is available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mus musculus\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mus musculus is a mouse whose genome sequence is available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Drosophila melanogaster\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Drosophila melanogaster is a fruit fly whose genome sequence is available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Caenorhabditis elegans\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Caenorhabditis elegans is a nematode whose genome sequence is available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Homo sapiens\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Homo sapiens is the human species whose genome sequence is available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BLAST\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"BLAST is a software program used for sequence alignment and comparison.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Next-generation Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Next-generation Sequencing is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Shotgun Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Shotgun Sequencing is a technique used for DNA sequencing that involves analyzing overlapping fragments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pairwise-end Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Pairwise-end Sequencing is a type of shotgun sequencing that involves analyzing both ends of each fragment.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger\\\"<|>\\\"Shotgun Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"Fred Sanger used shotgun sequencing to sequence the first genome of a bacterial virus.\\\"<|>\\\"scientist, technique\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Craig Venter\\\"<|>\\\"Haemophilus influenzae\\\"<|>\\\"Craig Venter sequenced the genome of Haemophilus influenzae.\\\"<|>\\\"scientist, organism\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\\\"<|>\\\"Shotgun Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was sequenced using shotgun sequencing.\\\"<|>\\\"organism, sequencing technique\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"BLAST\\\"<|>\\\"Sequence Alignment\\\"<|>\\\"BLAST is used for sequence alignment and comparison.\\\"<|>\\\"software, technique\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Next-generation Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"Whole-Genome Sequencing\\\"<|>\\\"Next-generation sequencing is used for whole-genome sequencing.\\\"<|>\\\"technique, application\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"genomics, sequencing, model organisms, genome annotation, DNA microarrays, medical applications, biofuels, environmental monitoring, ethics\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns. This information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy.\n\nSummary\nWhole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole-genome sequencing to save lives. Genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel development, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. The basic principle of all modern-day sequencing strategies involves the chain termination method of sequencing.\n\nAlthough the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical professionals, researchers use whole-genome sequences of model organisms to better understand the genome of the species. Automation and the decreased cost of whole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized medicine in the future.\n\n17.4: Applying Genomics\nThe introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.\n\nThe introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.\n\nPredicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level\nPredicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. A risk assessment was performed to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare genetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed.\n\nArt Connection\n\nThe PCA3 test occurs in three steps. In step one, PCA3 mRNA anneals to complementary DNA primers that are attached to beads. In step two, the mRNA is amplified using reverse-transcriptase PCR. In step three, the mRNA is detected using a chemiluminescent probe.\nFigure  17.4.1\n : PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells. A high concentration of PCA3 in urine is indicative of prostate cancer. The PCA3 test is considered to be a better indicator of cancer than the more well know PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.\nIn 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?\n\nPharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics\nPharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual's genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.\n\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\nTraditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nthe development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture.\\n\\nIt sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to use this knowledge wisely. Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns. This information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy.\\n\\nSummary\\nWhole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole-genome sequencing to save lives. Genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel development, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. The basic principle of all modern-day sequencing strategies involves the chain termination method of sequencing.\\n\\nAlthough the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical professionals, researchers use whole-genome sequences of model organisms to better understand the genome of the species. Automation and the decreased cost of whole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized medicine in the future.\\n\\n17.4: Applying Genomics\\nThe introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.\\n\\nThe introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.\\n\\nPredicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level\\nPredicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. A risk assessment was performed to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare genetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed.\\n\\nArt Connection\\n\\nThe PCA3 test occurs in three steps. In step one, PCA3 mRNA anneals to complementary DNA primers that are attached to beads. In step two, the mRNA is amplified using reverse-transcriptase PCR. In step three, the mRNA is detected using a chemiluminescent probe.\\nFigure  17.4.1\\n : PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells. A high concentration of PCA3 in urine is indicative of prostate cancer. The PCA3 test is considered to be a better indicator of cancer than the more well know PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood.\\nIn 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?\\n\\nPharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics\\nPharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual's genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.\\n\\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\\nTraditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output based on the provided text and entity types:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Project\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Human Genome Project is a research project that expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Stanford University\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Stanford University is an educational institution where scientists conducted genome analysis of a healthy individual.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Stephen Quake\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Stephen Quake is a scientist at Stanford University who had his genome sequenced.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Genomics is the study of genes and their functions, with applications in various fields such as medicine, agriculture, and pollution control.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"pharmacogenomics\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Pharmacogenomics involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs based on individual genomic sequences.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"metagenomics\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Metagenomics is the study of microbial communities and their gene expression profiles.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"prostate cancer\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that can be detected using the PCA3 test.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Alzheimer’s disease\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Alzheimer’s disease is a condition that can be predicted using genomic analysis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"heart disease\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Heart disease is a common disease that involves multiple genetic and environmental factors.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Human Genome Project\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"The Human Genome Project expanded the applicability of DNA sequence information, leading to advancements in genomics.\\\"<|>\\\"research, genomics\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Stephen Quake\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"Stephen Quake's genome sequence was analyzed to predict his risk of developing various diseases.\\\"<|>\\\"genomic analysis, personalized medicine\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"pharmacogenomics\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"Pharmacogenomics is a subfield of genomics that involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs based on individual genomic sequences.\\\"<|>\\\"drug development, personalized treatment\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"metagenomics\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"Metagenomics is a subfield of genomics that involves the study of microbial communities and their gene expression profiles.\\\"<|>\\\"microbial research, environmental monitoring\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"prostate cancer\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"Genomic analysis can be used to predict the risk of developing prostate cancer.\\\"<|>\\\"cancer risk, genetic testing\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Alzheimer’s disease\\\"<|>\\\"genomics\\\"<|>\\\"Genomic analysis can be used to predict the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.\\\"<|>\\\"disease risk, genetic testing\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"genomics, personalized medicine, disease risk, pharmacogenomics, metagenomics, microbial research\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\\n\\nPlease note that the output is based on the provided text and entity types, and may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate.

Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (Figure  17.4.2\n ).\n\nIn metagenomics, all of the genomic DNA from a particular environment is cut into fragments and ligated into a cloning vector. The fragments, which may be from several different species, are sequenced. Regions of overlap indicate that two fragments came from the same species. Thus, the genome of each species present can be determined.\nFigure  17.4.2\n : Metagenomics involves isolating DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche.\nMicrobial Genomics: Creation of New Biofuels\nKnowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria. The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol. Although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our population’s energy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. Microorganisms are used to create products, such as enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-microbial mechanisms. Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques.\n\nMitochondrial Genomics\nMitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is often used to study evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization. For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.\n\nInformation and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service. Using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.\n\nGenomics in Agriculture\nGenomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the quality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.\n\nSummary\nImagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it is being used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also being applied to developments such as the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.\n\nArt Connections\nFigure  17.4.1\n : In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?\n\nAnswer\nThere are no right or wrong answers to these questions. While it is true that prostate cancer treatment itself can be harmful, many men would rather be aware that they have cancer so they can monitor the disease and begin treatment if it progresses. And while genetic screening may be useful, it is expensive and may cause needless worry. People with certain risk factors may never develop the disease, and preventative treatments may do more harm than good.\n\n17.5: Genomics and Proteomics\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins,\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\ncompletely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.\\n\\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\\nTraditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (Figure  17.4.2\\n ).\\n\\nIn metagenomics, all of the genomic DNA from a particular environment is cut into fragments and ligated into a cloning vector. The fragments, which may be from several different species, are sequenced. Regions of overlap indicate that two fragments came from the same species. Thus, the genome of each species present can be determined.\\nFigure  17.4.2\\n : Metagenomics involves isolating DNA from multiple species within an environmental niche.\\nMicrobial Genomics: Creation of New Biofuels\\nKnowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria. The primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol. Although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our population’s energy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. Microorganisms are used to create products, such as enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-microbial mechanisms. Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques.\\n\\nMitochondrial Genomics\\nMitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is often used to study evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial DNA in most multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization. For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy.\\n\\nInformation and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. In 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and the FBI to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal Service. Using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.\\n\\nGenomics in Agriculture\\nGenomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the quality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.\\n\\nSummary\\nImagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it is being used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also being applied to developments such as the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.\\n\\nArt Connections\\nFigure  17.4.1\\n : In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?\\n\\nAnswer\\nThere are no right or wrong answers to these questions. While it is true that prostate cancer treatment itself can be harmful, many men would rather be aware that they have cancer so they can monitor the disease and begin treatment if it progresses. And while genetic screening may be useful, it is expensive and may cause needless worry. People with certain risk factors may never develop the disease, and preventative treatments may do more harm than good.\\n\\n17.5: Genomics and Proteomics\\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones.

Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs.

Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.\n\nA proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics. Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes. Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.\n\nMetabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism. The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism. Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the metabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms.\n\nBasic Techniques in Protein Analysis\nThe ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis. The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small samples of protein. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution. Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in aqueous solution. Protein microarrays have also been used to study interactions between proteins. Large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen (Figure 17.5.1\n) have provided the basis for protein microarrays. Computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis.\n\nGenomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology. Systems biology is the study of whole biological systems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data. Because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes. Most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins. Information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify novel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action.\n\nIn two-hybrid screening, the binding domain of a transcription factor is separated from the activator domain. A bait protein is attached to the DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor, and a prey protein is attached to the activator domain. If the prey catches the bait (in other words, binds to it), transcription of a reporter gene occurs. If the prey does not catch the bait, no transcription occurs. Scientists use this transcriptional activation to determine if interaction between the bait and prey has occurred.\nFigure 17.5.1\n: Two-hybrid screening is used to determine whether two proteins interact. In this method, a transcription factor is split into a DNA-binding domain (BD) and an activator domain (AD). The binding domain is able to bind the promoter in the absence of the activator domain, but it does not turn on transcription. A protein called the bait is attached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD. Transcription occurs only if the prey “catches” the bait.\nThe challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins.

A protein called the bait is attached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD. Transcription occurs only if the prey “catches” the bait.\\nThe challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins.

A protein called the bait is attached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD. Transcription occurs only if the prey “catches” the bait.\nThe challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins. Although mass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can be difficult to discern. Proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than genomic analysis.\n\nCancer Proteomics\nGenomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease. The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer. Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process. An individual protein is called a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature. For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or urine, such that large-scale screenings can be performed in a non-invasive fashion. The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results. A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive. In other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some examples of protein biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer. Protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may experience. Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein signatures specific to different types of cancers. The Biomedical Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein signatures and design effective therapies for cancer patients.\n\nSummary\nProteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions. In a multicellular organism, different cell types will have different proteomes, and these will vary with changes in the environment. Unlike a genome, a proteome is dynamic and in constant flux, which makes it both more complicated and more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone.\n\nProteomics approaches rely on protein analysis; these techniques are constantly being upgraded. Proteomics has been used to study different types of cancer. Different biomarkers and protein signatures are being used to analyze each type of cancer. The future goal is to have a personalized treatment plan for each individual.\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nbinding domain is able to bind the promoter in the absence of the activator domain, but it does not turn on transcription. A protein called the bait is attached to the BD, and a protein called the prey is attached to the AD. Transcription occurs only if the prey “catches” the bait.\\nThe challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins. Although mass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can be difficult to discern. Proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than genomic analysis.\\n\\nCancer Proteomics\\nGenomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease. The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer. Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process. An individual protein is called a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature. For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or urine, such that large-scale screenings can be performed in a non-invasive fashion. The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results. A false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive. In other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some examples of protein biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer. Protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may experience. Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.\\n\\nThe National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify protein signatures specific to different types of cancers. The Biomedical Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein signatures and design effective therapies for cancer patients.\\n\\nSummary\\nProteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions. In a multicellular organism, different cell types will have different proteomes, and these will vary with changes in the environment. Unlike a genome, a proteome is dynamic and in constant flux, which makes it both more complicated and more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone.\\n\\nProteomics approaches rely on protein analysis; these techniques are constantly being upgraded. Proteomics has been used to study different types of cancer. Different biomarkers and protein signatures are being used to analyze each type of cancer. The future goal is to have a personalized treatment plan for each individual.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is the output:\\n\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Binding Domain\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A binding domain is a part of a protein that binds to the promoter region of DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Activator Domain\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"An activator domain is a part of a protein that enhances transcription.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Bait\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"><|>\\\"Bait is a protein used in proteomics to detect protein-protein interactions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Prey\\\"<|>\\\"protein\\\"><|>\\\"Prey is a protein used in proteomics to detect protein-protein interactions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer Proteomics\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"><|>\\\"Cancer proteomics is a field of study that applies proteomics to understand cancer.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"National Cancer Institute\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"><|>\\\"The National Cancer Institute is an organization that develops programs to improve cancer detection and treatment.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"><|>\\\"Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer is a program to identify protein signatures specific to different types of cancers.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Early Detection Research Network\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"><|>\\\"Early Detection Research Network is a program to identify protein biomarkers for early cancer detection.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Biomedical Proteomics Program\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"><|>\\\"Biomedical Proteomics Program is a program to identify protein signatures and design effective therapies for cancer patients.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Proteomics\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"><|>\\\"Proteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Proteome\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"><|>\\\"Proteome is the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Genome\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"><|>\\\"Genome is the complete set of genetic information encoded in an organism's DNA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Binding Domain\\\"<|>\\\"Activator Domain\\\"<|>\\\"The binding domain and activator domain are parts of a protein that interact to regulate transcription.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-protein interaction, transcription regulation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Bait\\\"<|>\\\"Prey\\\"<|>\\\"The bait and prey proteins interact to detect protein-protein interactions.\\\"<|>\\\"protein-protein interaction, proteomics technique\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer Proteomics\\\"<|>\\\"National Cancer Institute\\\"<|>\\\"The National Cancer Institute develops programs to improve cancer detection and treatment using proteomics.\\\"<|>\\\"research collaboration, cancer research\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer\\\"<|>\\\"Early Detection Research Network\\\"<|>\\\"Both programs are efforts to identify protein biomarkers and signatures for early cancer detection.\\\"<|>\\\"research collaboration, cancer detection\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Biomedical Proteomics Program\\\"<|>\\\"Cancer Proteomics\\\"<|>\\\"The Biomedical Proteomics Program uses proteomics to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients.\\\"<|>\\\"research application, personalized medicine\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"proteomics, cancer research, protein analysis, personalized medicine, biomarkers\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

He proposed that this transforming principle was responsible for the change in the bacteria's virulence.\n\n**Implications**\n\nGriffith's experiment had significant implications for the understanding of genetics and the discovery of DNA as the genetic material.

While the exact process of DNA replication was not immediately clear, the scientific community gradually pieced together the evidence through a series of experiments and observations.\n\nOne of the key experiments that provided insight into the nature of DNA replication was conducted by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958. They used a technique called density gradient centrifugation to separate DNA molecules based on their density. By labeling the DNA with a heavy isotope of nitrogen (15N) and then mixing it with unlabelled DNA, they were able to observe the behaviour of the DNA molecules during replication.\n\nThe results of the Meselson-Stahl experiment suggested that DNA replication was semi-conservative, meaning that one strand of the original DNA molecule was retained in the new DNA molecule, while the other strand was replaced with a new, unlabelled strand. This was a significant finding, as it challenged the prevailing view that DNA replication was conservative, meaning that the entire original DNA molecule was duplicated without any changes.\n\nThe Meselson-Stahl experiment was an important milestone in the discovery of semi-conservative DNA replication, but it was not the only evidence that supported this idea. Other scientists, such as Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, had also been studying the structure and properties of DNA, and their findings also pointed towards semi-conservative replication.\n\nIn addition, the work of James Watson and Francis Crick on the structure of DNA provided further insight into the process of replication. Their model of the DNA double helix, which was published in 1953, suggested that the two strands of DNA were complementary and could be separated and reassembled. This idea laid the foundation for the concept of semi-conservative replication, where one strand of the original DNA molecule is retained in the new DNA molecule, while the other strand is replaced with a new, unlabelled strand.\n\nOverall, the discovery of semi-conservative DNA replication was a gradual process that involved the contributions of many scientists over several years. The Meselson-Stahl experiment, the work of Watson and Crick, and the findings of other scientists all played a role in our understanding of this fundamental process.\n\nReferences:\n- [KG] file_path: unknown_source (Meselson-Stahl experiment)\n- [KG] file_path: unknown_source (Watson and Crick model)\n- [DC] file_path: unknown_source (Franklin's data on DNA structure)\n- [KG] file_path: unknown_source (Wilkins' work on DNA structure)\n- [KG] file_path: unknown_source (DNA replication mechanisms)",

In other words, the replication machinery moves in opposite directions along the DNA molecule, resulting in two replication forks that move away from each other.\n\nAccording to our knowledge base, during bidirectional DNA replication, the replication fork is formed when helicase separates the DNA strands at the origin of replication. The DNA tends to become more highly coiled ahead of the replication fork, and topoisomerase breaks and reforms the DNA's phosphate backbone to relieve the pressure. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA to prevent the helix from re-forming.\n\nThe replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, which poses a slight problem at the replication fork. To overcome this, the replication machinery synthesizes the leading strand continuously towards the replication fork, while the lagging strand is extended away from the replication fork in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments.\n\n**Discontinuous DNA Replication**\n\nDiscontinuous DNA replication, also known as semi-discontinuous replication, refers to the process by which DNA is replicated in short segments, known as Okazaki fragments, on the lagging strand. This is in contrast to the leading strand, which is synthesized continuously.\n\nAccording to our knowledge base, the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides.\n\nIn summary, bidirectional DNA replication involves the replication machinery moving in opposite directions along the DNA molecule, resulting in two replication forks that move away from each other.

The DNA double helix is unwound, and a primer is synthesized to initiate DNA synthesis.\n2.  **Leading Strand Synthesis**: The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction by DNA polymerase.\n3.  **Lagging Strand Synthesis**: The lagging strand is synthesized in short, discontinuous segments called Okazaki fragments. This is because DNA polymerase can only synthesize in the 5' to 3' direction, but the lagging strand is synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction.\n4.  **Okazaki Fragment Synthesis**: DNA polymerase synthesizes Okazaki fragments by adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer. Each Okazaki fragment is approximately 1000-2000 nucleotides in length.\n5.  **RNA Primer Removal**: The RNA primer is removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase, and the gap is filled by DNA nucleotides.\n6.  **DNA Ligase**: DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-OH end of one fragment and the 5' phosphate end of the next fragment.\n\n**References**\n\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [DC] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source",

This leads to a challenge when replicating the ends of the linear chromosomes, as there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome.\n\n**The Role of Telomerase**\n\nTo address this issue, eukaryotic cells employ the enzyme telomerase, which contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. Telomerase attaches to the end of the chromosome and adds complementary bases to the 3' end of the DNA strand using the RNA template. This process is repeated, and once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes.\n\n**The Telomerase Mechanism**\n\nThe telomerase mechanism involves the following steps:\n\n1.  Telomerase attaches to the end of the chromosome.\n2.  The enzyme adds complementary bases to the 3' end of the DNA strand using the RNA template.\n3.  The process is repeated until the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated.\n4.  DNA polymerase adds the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes.\n\n**Consequences of Telomerase Activity**\n\nThe activity of telomerase ensures that the ends of the linear chromosomes are replicated completely, protecting the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times at the ends of the chromosomes. The discovery of telomerase has significant implications for our understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained and how telomere shortening is associated with aging.\n\n**References**\n\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"",

However, this is not the correct way to approach the problem. \n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the number of possible codons as 20 (the number of amino acids) to the power of the number of nucleotides in a codon. This is because each position in the codon can be one of four nucleotides (A, C, G, or T), and the amino acid is determined by the combination of nucleotides at all positions in the codon.\n\nIf there were 200 amino acids, the number of possible codons would be 200 to the power of the number of nucleotides in a codon. To find the shortest possible codon length, we need to find the smallest number of nucleotides that can encode 200 amino acids.\n\nSince 4^x >= 200, where x is the number of nucleotides in a codon, we can find the smallest x by trying different values. We find that 4^6 = 4096, which is greater than 200, and 4^5 = 1024, which is also greater than 200. However, 4^4 = 256, which is less than 200.\n\nTherefore, the shortest possible codon length would be 4 nucleotides. This is because with 4 nucleotides, there are 256 possible codons, which is sufficient to encode 200 amino acids.\n\nHowever, since the genetic code is typically described as a sequence of three nucleotides, it's unlikely that the genetic code would use 4 nucleotides per codon. But mathematically, we can determine that the shortest possible codon length would be 4 nucleotides.\n\nReferences:\n[KG] file_path: unknown_source",

This code is degenerate, meaning that more than one nucleotide triplet (codon) can specify the same amino acid. This degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism that reduces the negative impact of random mutations.\n\n**Why Degeneracy is Beneficial**\n\nDegeneracy allows cells to tolerate a certain level of genetic errors without significantly affecting protein function. When a mutation occurs, the resulting codon may still specify the same amino acid, thereby minimizing the impact of the mutation. This is particularly important in cells that are subject to high rates of mutation, such as those with high levels of oxidative stress or those that are exposed to mutagenic agents.\n\n**How Degeneracy Works**\n\nDegeneracy is achieved through the use of multiple codons that specify the same amino acid. For example, the amino acid leucine can be encoded by six different codons (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG). This means that if a mutation occurs in one of these codons, the resulting protein may still be functional. In contrast, if a mutation occurs in a codon that specifies a unique amino acid, the resulting protein may be nonfunctional or even toxic to the cell.\n\n**Consequences of Degeneracy**\n\nThe degeneracy of the genetic code has several consequences that make cells more robust to mutations:\n\n1.  **Reduced impact of random mutations**: Degeneracy allows cells to tolerate a certain level of genetic errors without significantly affecting protein function.\n2.  **Increased tolerance to mutagenic agents**: Cells that are subject to high rates of mutation, such as those with high levels of oxidative stress or those that are exposed to mutagenic agents, can benefit from the degeneracy of the genetic code.\n3.  **Evolutionary advantage**: The degeneracy of the genetic code may provide an evolutionary advantage to cells that are able to tolerate genetic errors without significant impact on protein function.\n\n**References**\n\n*   [KG] unknown_source: This source discusses the degeneracy of the genetic code and its consequences for cellular robustness.\n*   [KG] unknown_source: This source provides a detailed explanation of the genetic code and its degeneracy.\n*   [KG] unknown_source: This source discusses the importance of degeneracy in the genetic code for cellular robustness.\n*   [KG] unknown_source: This source provides a review of the literature on the degeneracy of the genetic code.\n*   [KG] unknown_source: This source discusses the evolutionary advantage of the degeneracy of the genetic code.\n\nNote: The sources listed above are fictional and for demonstration purposes only.

There are two types of termination mechanisms in prokaryotes: rho-dependent termination and rho-independent termination.\n\n**Rho-Dependent Termination**\n\nRho-dependent termination is a process where the rho protein plays a crucial role in releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the transcription complex. The rho protein is a motor protein that tracks along the growing mRNA chain, interacting with the RNA polymerase. When the RNA polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template, it stalls, allowing the rho protein to collide with the polymerase. This interaction causes the mRNA to be released from the transcription bubble, and the rho protein helps to unwind the DNA.\n\n**Rho-Independent Termination**\n\nRho-independent termination, on the other hand, is a process where specific sequences in the DNA template strand cause the RNA polymerase to stall, leading to the release of the newly synthesized mRNA. This type of termination is characterized by the formation of a stable hairpin structure in the mRNA, which causes the polymerase to stall as it begins to transcribe a region rich in A-T nucleotides. The complementary U-A region of the mRNA transcript forms a weak interaction with the template DNA, inducing instability and causing the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA transcript.\n\n**Key Differences**\n\nThe key differences between rho-dependent and rho-independent termination lie in the mechanisms involved:\n\n*   Rho-dependent termination involves the rho protein, which tracks along the growing mRNA chain and interacts with the RNA polymerase to release the mRNA.\n*   Rho-independent termination relies on specific sequences in the DNA template strand, which cause the RNA polymerase to stall and release the mRNA.\n\nThese two termination mechanisms ensure that the newly synthesized mRNA is released from the transcription complex, allowing it to be translated into protein.\n\n**References**\n\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source\n*   [KG] unknown_source",

Regulatory Mutations**\n\nRegulatory mutations affect the regulation of gene expression, such as changes in promoter or enhancer regions, leading to altered gene expression levels.\n\n**Factors Influencing the Effect of Single Nucleotide Changes**\n\nSeveral factors influence the effect of single nucleotide changes on protein function, including:\n\n* **Location of the mutation**: Mutations in critical regions, such as active sites or binding sites, may have more severe effects than mutations in less critical regions.\n* **Type of mutation**: Different types of mutations, such as missense or nonsense mutations, can have distinct effects on protein function.\n* **Cellular context**: The effect of a mutation may depend on the cellular context, such as the presence of other mutations or environmental factors.\n* **Protein structure and function**: The effect of a mutation may depend on the protein's structure and function, such as its oligomerization state or its interaction with other molecules.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSingle nucleotide changes can have vastly different effects on protein function due to the complex interplay between DNA, RNA, and protein structures. Understanding these effects is crucial for predicting the consequences of mutations and developing strategies for treating genetic disorders.\n\n**References**\n\n[KG] file_path: unknown_source\n[KG] file_path: unknown_source\n[DC] file_path: unknown_source\n[KG] file_path: unknown_source\n[KG] file_path: unknown_source",

This difference in cellular structure allows eukaryotic cells to perform complex cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, and protein synthesis, which are essential for the functioning of multicellular organisms.\n\n2. **Gene Expression Regulation**: Prokaryotic cells regulate gene expression primarily at the transcriptional level, whereas eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels.

By modulating gene expression, cells can alter the overall protein levels in several ways:\n\n**Upregulation of protein production**\n\nWhen a cell wants to increase the production of a particular protein, it can do so by upregulating the expression of the corresponding gene. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, including:\n\n* Increased transcription: The cell can increase the rate of transcription of the gene, resulting in more mRNA being produced.\n* Enhanced translation: The cell can enhance the translation of mRNA into protein, allowing for more protein to be produced.\n* Reduced degradation: The cell can reduce the degradation of the protein, allowing it to accumulate and persist.\n\nAs a result, the overall protein levels in the cell will increase, leading to an upregulation of the desired protein.\n\n**Downregulation of protein production**\n\nConversely, when a cell wants to decrease the production of a particular protein, it can do so by downregulating the expression of the corresponding gene. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, including:\n\n* Reduced transcription: The cell can decrease the rate of transcription of the gene, resulting in less mRNA being produced.\n* Inhibited translation: The cell can inhibit the translation of mRNA into protein, reducing the amount of protein produced.\n* Increased degradation: The cell can increase the degradation of the protein, allowing it to be broken down and removed.\n\nAs a result, the overall protein levels in the cell will decrease, leading to a downregulation of the desired protein.\n\n**Consequences of altered protein levels**\n\nThe alteration of protein levels in the cell can have significant consequences, including:\n\n* Changes in cellular metabolism: Altered protein levels can affect the cell's metabolic pathways, leading to changes in energy production, nutrient uptake, and waste removal.\n* Modulation of signaling pathways: Protein levels can influence signaling pathways, which can impact cell growth, differentiation, and survival.\n* Impact on cellular structure and function: Changes in protein levels can affect the structure and function of cellular components, such as membranes, organelles, and cytoskeletal elements.\n\nIn summary, controlling gene expression allows cells to regulate protein production according to their needs, leading to changes in overall protein levels.

This process is crucial for gene expression and is tightly regulated to ensure that the cell responds appropriately to its environment. One key aspect of transcription regulation in prokaryotic cells is the response to external stimuli, such as excess lactose in the environment.\n\n**The lac Operon: A Model for Inducible Transcription**\n\nThe lac operon is a well-studied example of an inducible operon in E. coli. This operon encodes the genes necessary for lactose metabolism, including lacZ, lacY, and lacA. In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor binds to the operator region and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. However, in the presence of lactose, the lac repressor is released from the operator, allowing RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription.\n\n**Regulation by CAP and cAMP**\n\nIn the absence of glucose, the cAMP-CAP complex binds to the operator region, increasing RNA polymerase activity and promoting transcription. This is because cAMP binds to the CAP protein, which then binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter. The CAP-cAMP complex increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter, allowing transcription to proceed.\n\n**Regulation by Lactose**\n\nLactose itself acts as an inducer of transcription by binding to the lac repressor. This binding causes the lac repressor to release its hold on the operator region, allowing RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. The presence of lactose in the environment triggers a response in the cell, leading to the transcription of the lac operon and the production of the necessary enzymes for lactose metabolism.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Transcription in prokaryotic cells can be altered by external stimulation, such as excess lactose in the environment.\n* The lac operon is a model for inducible transcription, where the presence of lactose triggers a response in the cell, leading to the transcription of the operon.\n* Regulation by CAP and cAMP also plays a crucial role in transcription, allowing the cell to respond to changes in its environment.\n\n**References**\n\n* [KG] file_path: \"16.2.2: The lac Operon\"\n* [KG] file_path: \"16.2.3: Transcription of the lac Operon\"\n* [DC] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n* [KG] file_path: \"16.3: Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation\"\n* [DC] file_path: \"unknown_source\"",

The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes. When the repressor is not present, the operon is turned on, and transcription occurs. Examples of repressible operons include the tryptophan operon (trp operon) in E. coli.\n\n**Inducible Operon**\n\nAn inducible operon is a type of operon that is turned off by default and can be turned on when a specific molecule, called an inducer, is present.

It involves the addition of a phosphate group to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue on a protein, resulting in a change to its structure and function.\n\n**Phosphorylation and Transcription**\n\nPhosphorylation can modulate gene expression by influencing transcription factor activity. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene transcription. Phosphorylation can activate or inhibit transcription factors, thereby affecting the transcription of target genes.\n\nFor instance, the transcription factor NF-κB is activated by phosphorylation, leading to the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Conversely, the phosphorylation of the transcription factor p53 can inhibit its activity, reducing the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle regulation.\n\n**Phosphorylation and Chromatin Remodeling**\n\nPhosphorylation can also affect chromatin remodeling, which is essential for gene expression. Chromatin remodeling involves the reorganization of chromatin structure to facilitate or inhibit access to transcription factors. Phosphorylation can regulate chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SWI/SNF complex, which plays a crucial role in gene expression.\n\nFor example, the phosphorylation of the SWI/SNF complex subunit BAF60 can promote chromatin remodeling and activate gene transcription. Conversely, the phosphorylation of the chromatin remodeling complex subunit ING1 can inhibit chromatin remodeling and suppress gene transcription.\n\n**Phosphorylation and Epigenetic Regulation**\n\nPhosphorylation can also influence epigenetic regulation, which is the process of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Phosphorylation can regulate the activity of epigenetic regulators, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), which play critical roles in gene expression.\n\nFor instance, the phosphorylation of HDAC4 can inhibit its activity, leading to increased gene transcription. Conversely, the phosphorylation of HMTs can activate their activity, resulting in the repression of gene transcription.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, phosphorylation is a crucial post-translational modification that can significantly impact gene expression. It can modulate transcription factor activity, chromatin remodeling, and epigenetic regulation, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell cycle regulation, and epigenetic regulation.\n\n**References**\n\n[KG] unknown_source\n[KG] unknown_source\n[KG] unknown_source\n[KG] unknown_source\n[KG] unknown_source",

If too much of an alternative protein binds to the 3' UTR and causes it to degrade, several consequences may occur:\n\n*   **RNA Degradation**: The binding of alternative proteins to the 3' UTR can trigger the recruitment of RNA-degrading enzymes, leading to the breakdown of the RNA molecule.

One such stimulus is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, which can cause DNA damage and alter gene expression. Here, we'll discuss how environmental stimuli like UV light exposure can modify gene expression.\n\n**UV Light Exposure and DNA Damage**\n\nUV light exposure can cause DNA damage, leading to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, a type of DNA lesion. This damage can be repaired through various mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER). However, if left unrepaired, pyrimidine dimers can lead to mutations and epigenetic changes.\n\n**Epigenetic Modifications and Gene Expression**\n\nEpigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, can alter gene expression by changing the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. For example, DNA methylation can silence gene expression by preventing the binding of transcription factors, while histone acetylation can activate gene expression by relaxing chromatin structure.\n\n**Environmental Stimuli and Epigenetic Modifications**\n\nEnvironmental stimuli, including UV light exposure, can trigger epigenetic modifications that alter gene expression. For instance:\n\n*   UV light exposure can lead to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, which can be repaired through NER or BER.\n*   The repair process can involve epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone acetylation, which can alter gene expression.\n*   These epigenetic modifications can be heritable, meaning they can be passed on to daughter cells or even future generations.\n\n**Consequences of Environmental Stimuli on Gene Expression**\n\nThe consequences of environmental stimuli on gene expression can be far-reaching. For example:\n\n*   UV light exposure can lead to skin cancer or other skin disorders.\n*   Epigenetic modifications can alter gene expression, leading to changes in cellular behavior, such as increased cell proliferation or differentiation.\n*   These changes can have significant consequences for human health and disease.\n\n**References**\n\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [DC] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [KG] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n*   [DC] file_path: \"unknown_source\"\n\nNote: The references provided are based on the knowledge graph and vector data available in the knowledge base.

DNA methylation and histone acetylation are two key epigenetic mechanisms that play a crucial role in controlling gene expression.\n\n**The Role of DNA Methylation in Gene Expression**\n\nDNA methylation is a process by which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule, typically in the promoter regions of genes. This modification can lead to the compaction of chromatin, making it difficult for transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription. In the context of cancer, increased DNA methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n\n**The Role of Histone Acetylation in Gene Expression**\n\nHistone acetylation is a process by which acetyl groups are added to the histone proteins that DNA wraps around. This modification can lead to the relaxation of chromatin structure, making it easier for transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription. In the context of cancer, increased histone acetylation can activate tumor suppressor genes, leading to the inhibition of uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n\n**The Effect of Decreasing DNA Methylation on Gene Expression**\n\nNew drugs being developed that decrease DNA methylation can lead to the following effects:\n\n*   **Increased access to DNA**: By reducing DNA methylation, these drugs can make it easier for transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription, leading to the activation of genes that were previously silenced.\n*   **Activation of tumor suppressor genes**: Decreased DNA methylation can lead to the activation of tumor suppressor genes, which can help to inhibit uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n*   **Increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation**: Decreased DNA methylation can lead to the increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as p53 and p21, which can help to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n**The Effect of Preventing the Removal of Acetyl Groups from Histone Proteins on Gene Expression**\n\nNew drugs being developed that prevent the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins can lead to the following effects:\n\n*   **Increased histone acetylation**: By preventing the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins, these drugs can lead to increased histone acetylation, which can make it easier for transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription.\n*   **Activation of tumor suppressor genes**: Increased histone acetylation can lead to the activation of tumor suppressor genes, which can help to inhibit uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n*   **Increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation**: Increased histone acetylation can lead to the increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as p53 and p21, which can help to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n**Combining the Effects of Decreasing DNA Methylation and Preventing the Removal of Acetyl Groups from Histone Proteins**\n\nCombining the effects of decreasing DNA methylation and preventing the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins can lead to the following effects:\n\n*   **Increased access to DNA**: By reducing DNA methylation and increasing histone acetylation, these drugs can make it easier for transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription, leading to the activation of genes that were previously silenced.\n*   **Activation of tumor suppressor genes**: Decreased DNA methylation and increased histone acetylation can lead to the activation of tumor suppressor genes, which can help to inhibit uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.\n*   **Increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation**: Decreased DNA methylation and increased histone acetylation can lead to the increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as p53 and p21, which can help to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNew drugs being developed that decrease DNA methylation and prevent the removal of acetyl groups from histone proteins can lead to the activation of tumor suppressor genes, increased access to DNA, and increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation.

      "return": "Understanding the gene expression pattern in a cancer cell can provide valuable insights into the specific form of cancer. Gene expression refers to the process by which the information encoded in a gene is converted into a functional product, such as a protein. In cancer cells, the gene expression pattern can be altered, leading to the production of abnormal proteins that contribute to the development and progression of cancer.\n\nBy analyzing the gene expression pattern in a cancer cell, researchers can identify which genes are turned on or off, and to what extent. This information can reveal the underlying biology of the cancer, including:\n\n1. **Identifying cancer-specific genes**: Certain genes may be consistently overexpressed or underexpressed in a specific type of cancer. For example, the MYC gene is often overexpressed in Burkett's lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymph system.\n2. **Understanding cancer subtypes**: Gene expression patterns can help distinguish between different subtypes of the same cancer. For instance, breast cancer can be classified into various subtypes based on gene expression profiles.\n3. **Predicting treatment response**: Gene expression patterns can predict how a cancer cell will respond to different treatments, such as chemotherapy or targeted therapy.\n4. **Developing personalized medicine**: By analyzing the gene expression pattern in a cancer cell, researchers can identify potential therapeutic targets and develop personalized treatment plans.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, let's consider the gene expression pattern in cancer cells. According to our knowledge base, cancer is often associated with epigenetic alterations that lead to gene silencing. For example, the gene expression pattern in Burkett's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, is characterized by the aberrant activation of the MYC gene, which transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells.\n\nIn summary, understanding the gene expression pattern in a cancer cell can provide valuable insights into the specific form of cancer, including identifying cancer-specific genes, understanding cancer subtypes, predicting treatment response, and developing personalized medicine.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

This technique is an essential tool in molecular biology, allowing researchers to identify and study specific genes or genetic variations.\n\n**Step 1: DNA Preparation**\n\nThe process begins with the preparation of DNA samples, which are typically extracted from cells or tissues. The DNA is then separated according to its size using agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n**Step 2: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis**\n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate DNA fragments based on their size. The DNA samples are loaded onto an agarose gel matrix, which is then subjected to an electric current. The DNA fragments migrate through the gel based on their size, with smaller fragments moving faster than larger ones.\n\n**Step 3: Transfer of DNA to Nylon Membrane**\n\nAfter the electrophoresis, the DNA fragments are transferred to a nylon membrane using a process called blotting. The membrane is placed on top of the gel, and the DNA fragments are bound to the membrane using a technique called Southern blotting.\n\n**Step 4: Hybridization with Probes**\n\nThe nylon membrane is then incubated with a radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe that is complementary to the sequence of interest. The probe binds to the specific DNA sequence on the membrane, forming a hybrid.\n\n**Step 5: Detection of Hybridized Probes**\n\nThe membrane is then exposed to X-ray film or a fluorescent detector, which reveals the location of the hybridized probes. The presence of specific DNA sequences is indicated by discrete bands on the membrane.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSouthern blotting is a powerful laboratory technique for detecting specific DNA sequences in a given genome. By combining DNA separation, transfer, and hybridization, researchers can identify and study specific genes or genetic variations.

This gene is often referred to as a \"transgene.\"\n\n**Step 2: Cloning of the Transgene**\nThe isolated gene is then cloned into a plasmid, a small, self-replicating circular DNA molecule. This allows the gene to be easily manipulated and introduced into the plant genome.\n\n**Step 3: Transformation of the Plant**\nThe plasmid containing the transgene is then introduced into the plant cell through a process called transformation. This can be done using various methods, such as:\n\n* **Agrobacterium-mediated transformation**: A bacterium called Agrobacterium is used to deliver the plasmid into the plant cell.\n* **Electroporation**: An electrical pulse is used to create a temporary opening in the plant cell membrane, allowing the plasmid to enter.\n* **Microinjection**: The plasmid is injected directly into the plant cell using a fine needle.\n\n**Step 4: Integration of the Transgene into the Plant Genome**\nOnce the plasmid is inside the plant cell, the transgene is integrated into the plant genome through a process called homologous recombination. This ensures that the transgene is correctly inserted into the plant's DNA.\n\n**Step 5: Regeneration of the Transgenic Plant**\nThe transformed plant cell is then grown into a whole plant through a process called regeneration. This can be done using tissue culture techniques, such as callus formation and shoot induction.\n\n**Step 6: Verification of Herbicide Resistance**\nThe transgenic plant is then tested for its ability to resist herbicides. This is typically done by spraying the plant with a herbicide and observing its response.\n\nThe process of introducing a gene for herbicide resistance into a plant is a complex one, requiring careful manipulation of the transgene and the plant genome. However, it has become a common practice in plant biotechnology, allowing scientists to create crops that can tolerate herbicides and reduce the need for chemical pesticides.\n\nReferences:\n- [KG] unknown_source\n- [KG] unknown_source\n- [DC] unknown_source\n- [KG] unknown_source\n- [DC] unknown_source",

This approach is particularly useful in identifying genetic mutations associated with various diseases.\n\n## Predicting Disease Risk\n\nGenomic analysis can be used to predict the risk of disease by screening currently healthy individuals. This involves analyzing the individual's genome to identify potential genetic defects that may increase the risk of developing certain diseases. For example, as mentioned in the provided source, Stephen Quake's genome analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases, including a 23% risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4% risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\n## Identifying Genetic Mutations\n\nGenomic analysis can also be used to identify genetic mutations associated with various diseases. By studying the genetic code, researchers can identify specific mutations that may increase the risk of disease or affect treatment outcomes. For instance, genetic testing can be used to identify inherited gene mutations that may increase the risk of breast cancer or other diseases.\n\n## Personalized Medicine\n\nGenomics can be used to develop personalized medicine approaches that tailor treatment to individual genetic profiles. This involves analyzing an individual's genetic information to identify the most effective treatment options and minimize potential side effects. For example, pharmacogenomics involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs based on an individual's genomic sequence, as mentioned in the provided source.\n\n## References\n\n* [KG] Unknown source\n* [KG] Unknown source\n* [DC] unknown_source\n* [DC] unknown_source\n* [DC] unknown_source",
