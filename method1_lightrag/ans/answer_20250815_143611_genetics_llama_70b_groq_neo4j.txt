Question:
Discuss how degeneracy of the genetic code makes cells more robust to mutations.

Answer:
**Degeneracy of the Genetic Code: A Cellular Mechanism for Robustness to Mutations**

The genetic code is a set of rules that dictates how the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids in proteins. This code is degenerate, meaning that more than one nucleotide triplet (codon) can specify the same amino acid. This degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism that reduces the negative impact of random mutations.

**Why Degeneracy is Beneficial**

Degeneracy allows cells to tolerate a certain level of genetic errors without significantly affecting protein function. When a mutation occurs, the resulting codon may still specify the same amino acid, thereby minimizing the impact of the mutation. This is particularly important in cells that are subject to high rates of mutation, such as those with high levels of oxidative stress or those that are exposed to mutagenic agents.

**How Degeneracy Works**

Degeneracy is achieved through the use of multiple codons that specify the same amino acid. For example, the amino acid leucine can be encoded by six different codons (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG). This means that if a mutation occurs in one of these codons, the resulting protein may still be functional. In contrast, if a mutation occurs in a codon that specifies a unique amino acid, the resulting protein may be nonfunctional or even toxic to the cell.

**Consequences of Degeneracy**

The degeneracy of the genetic code has several consequences that make cells more robust to mutations:

1.  **Reduced impact of random mutations**: Degeneracy allows cells to tolerate a certain level of genetic errors without significantly affecting protein function.
2.  **Increased tolerance to mutagenic agents**: Cells that are subject to high rates of mutation, such as those with high levels of oxidative stress or those that are exposed to mutagenic agents, can benefit from the degeneracy of the genetic code.
3.  **Evolutionary advantage**: The degeneracy of the genetic code may provide an evolutionary advantage to cells that are able to tolerate genetic errors without significant impact on protein function.
