Question:
Transcribe and translate the following DNA sequence (nontemplate strand): 5'-ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3'

Answer:
To transcribe and translate the given DNA sequence, we need to follow these steps:

1. Transcription: Convert the DNA sequence to its complementary RNA sequence.
2. Translation: Convert the RNA sequence to its corresponding amino acid sequence.

**Transcription:**

The given DNA sequence is the nontemplate strand. To get the template strand, we need to find its complement. The base pairing rules are:

A-T, C-G, G-C, and T-A

The given DNA sequence is: 5'-ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3'

Its complement (template strand) is: 3'-TACCGGCCTAAATTGCTA-5'

Now, we can transcribe the template strand to its complementary RNA sequence:

The RNA sequence is: 5'-UACCGGCCTAAATTGCTA-3'

**Translation:**

To translate the RNA sequence to its corresponding amino acid sequence, we need to follow the standard genetic code. The RNA sequence is: 5'-UACCGGCCTAAATTGCTA-3'

We can break it down into codons:

1. UAC - Tyrosine (Tyr)
2. CGG - Arginine (Arg)
3. CTA - Leucine (Leu)
4. AAT - Asparagine (Asn)
5. TGG - Tryptophan (Trp)
6. CTA - Leucine (Leu)

The amino acid sequence is: Tyr-Arg-Leu-Asn-Trp-Leu

Note that this is a partial translation, as the given RNA sequence is not a complete coding region. In a real-world scenario, we would need more information to determine the complete amino acid sequence.
