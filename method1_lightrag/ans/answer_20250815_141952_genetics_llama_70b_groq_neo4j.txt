Question:
Provide a brief summary of the Sanger sequencing method.

Answer:
**Sanger Sequencing Method**
==========================

The Sanger sequencing method, also known as the dideoxy chain termination method, is a widely used technique for determining the order of nucleotide bases in a DNA molecule. Developed by Frederick Sanger in the 1970s, this method involves the use of chain terminators, specifically dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.

**Key Steps**
------------

1.  A DNA template is denatured and a primer is added to initiate DNA synthesis.
2.  A regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP) is mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs).
3.  DNA replication continues until a ddNTP is incorporated, terminating the reaction and resulting in multiple short strands of replicated DNA.
4.  The reaction mixture is then processed by gel electrophoresis, separating the DNA fragments based on size.
5.  The resulting gel shows a ladder of bands, each representing a DNA fragment terminated at a different point during replication.
6.  The sequence of the template strand is read by analyzing the size and color of each band.

**Advantages**
--------------

The Sanger sequencing method offers several advantages, including:

*   High accuracy and precision
*   Ability to detect differences in length of a single base
*   Use of fluorescently labeled ddNTPs for easy detection
