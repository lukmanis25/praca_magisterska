Question:
What are the specific categories of students for whom the dean may agree to implement an individual study plan upon receiving a request within 14 days of the semester's start?

Answer:
# Individual Study Plan

According to the provided document chunks, there is no mention of specific categories of students for whom the dean may agree to implement an individual study plan upon receiving a request within 14 days of the semester's start.

However, the document does mention that students have the right to have their dignity respected by every member of the academic community, acquire knowledge and skills, and develop their own scientific interests.

To answer the question directly, since the document does not provide the specific categories of students for whom the dean may agree to implement an individual study plan, I must say that the information is not available in the provided document chunks.

If you could provide more context or clarify the question, I would be happy to try and assist further.
