Question:
Describe the structure and complementary base pairing of DNA.

Answer:
**DNA Structure and Complementary Base Pairing**

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all known living organisms. It carries and contains genetic information, and is composed of two complementary strands.

**Double Helix Structure**

The double helix structure of DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides that are twisted together in a spiral fashion. Each strand is made up of a long chain of nucleotides, with each nucleotide consisting of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).

**Complementary Base Pairing**

The nitrogenous bases in DNA are paired in a complementary manner, with adenine (A) pairing with thymine (T) and guanine (G) pairing with cytosine (C). This complementary base pairing is crucial for the replication and transmission of genetic information.

**Base Pairing Rules**

The base pairing rules in DNA are as follows:

* Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T)
* Guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C)

These base pairing rules are essential for the proper functioning of DNA and are a fundamental aspect of molecular biology.
