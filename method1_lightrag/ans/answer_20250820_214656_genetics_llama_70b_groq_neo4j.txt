Question:
Transcribe and translate the following DNA sequence (nontemplate strand): 5'-ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3'

Answer:
**DNA Sequence Transcription and Translation**
=============================================

To transcribe and translate the given DNA sequence, we need to follow these steps:

### Transcription

Transcription is the process of converting the DNA sequence into a complementary RNA sequence.

The given DNA sequence is:
5'-ATGGCCGGTTATTAAGCA-3'

Since this is the non-template strand, we will use it as the template to create a complementary RNA sequence.

The RNA sequence is:
3'-UACGUCCAGUAUUAUUAGU-5'

### Translation

Translation is the process of converting the RNA sequence into a protein sequence.

To translate the RNA sequence, we need to break it down into codons, which are sequences of three nucleotides.

The RNA sequence is:
3'-UACGUCCAGUAUUAUUAGU-5'

Breaking it down into codons, we get:
UAC, GUC, CCA, GUA, UUA, UUU, AGU

Using the genetic code, we can translate these codons into amino acids:

UAC = Tyrosine (Tyr)
GUC = Valine (Val)
CCA = Proline (Pro)
GUA = Valine (Val)
UUA = Leucine (Leu)
UUU = Phenylalanine (Phe)
AGU = Arginine (Arg)

Therefore, the protein sequence is:
Tyr Val Pro Val Leu Phe Arg

Note that this is a hypothetical protein sequence, and the actual protein sequence may vary depending on the specific genetic context.
