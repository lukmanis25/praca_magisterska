Question:
Explain the events taking place at the replication fork. If the gene for helicase is mutated, what part of replication will be affected?

Answer:
**Replication Fork: Key Events**
=====================================

The replication fork is a crucial site in the process of DNA replication, where the double-stranded DNA is unwound and replicated. The key events taking place at the replication fork are:

*   **DNA unwinding**: Helicase, an enzyme, unwinds the double-stranded DNA, creating a replication fork.
*   **Single-strand binding proteins (SSB)**: SSB binds to the single-stranded DNA near the replication fork to keep the fork open and prevent the DNA from rewinding.
*   **Primase**: Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase.
*   **DNA polymerase**: DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer, synthesizing one strand (the leading strand) in the direction of the replication fork.
*   **Okazaki fragments**: The other strand (the lagging strand) is synthesized in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments, which are then joined together by DNA ligase.

**Impact of Helicase Mutation**
==============================

If the gene for helicase is mutated, the DNA unwinding process will be affected. Helicase is essential for unwinding the double-stranded DNA, creating the replication fork. Without functional helicase, the DNA replication process will be impaired, leading to:

*   **Incomplete DNA replication**: The replication fork will not be formed, and DNA synthesis will not occur.
*   **Cell cycle arrest**: The cell cycle will be arrested, preventing the cell from progressing through the cell cycle.

In summary, a mutation in the helicase gene will disrupt the DNA unwinding process, leading to incomplete DNA replication and cell cycle arrest.
