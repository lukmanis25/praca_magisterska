Question:
How would a scientist introduce a gene for herbicide resistance into a plant?

Answer:
**Introducing a Gene for Herbicide Resistance into a Plant**

Scientists can introduce a gene for herbicide resistance into a plant using a process called genetic engineering. One common method is by using a bacterium called Agrobacterium, which naturally transfers DNA from bacteria to plant cells.

Here's a simplified overview of the steps involved:

1. **Isolate the gene**: The scientist isolates the gene responsible for herbicide resistance from a source, such as a bacterium or another plant.
2. **Clone the gene**: The gene is then cloned into a plasmid, a small DNA molecule that can replicate independently of the cell's DNA.
3. **Transfer the gene**: The scientist uses Agrobacterium to transfer the cloned gene into the plant cells. This is done by infecting the plant cells with Agrobacterium, which naturally transfers its DNA into the plant cells.
4. **Select resistant cells**: The scientist selects and grows plant cells that have taken up the herbicide-resistant gene. These cells are then cultured to produce more resistant cells.
5. **Regenerate the plant**: The resistant cells are used to regenerate a whole plant through a process called tissue culture.

The Ti plasmid, a type of plasmid found in Agrobacterium, is commonly used for this purpose. The Ti plasmid contains genes for tumor induction in plants, but scientists can manipulate it to remove these genes and insert the desired gene, such as the one for herbicide resistance.

**Key Points**

* Agrobacterium is used to transfer DNA from bacteria to plant cells.
* The Ti plasmid is a common vector used for genetic engineering in plants.
* The process involves isolating and cloning the gene, transferring it into plant cells, selecting resistant cells, and regenerating the plant.
