Question:
Provide a brief summary of the Sanger sequencing method.

Answer:
**Sanger Sequencing Method Summary**

The Sanger sequencing method, also known as the dideoxy chain termination method, is a widely used technique for determining the order of nucleotide bases in a DNA molecule. Developed by Frederick Sanger, this method involves the use of chain terminators, called dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), to generate DNA fragments of different sizes.

Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **DNA Denaturation**: The DNA sample is denatured, or separated, into two strands.
2. **Primer Annealing**: A primer, a short piece of DNA complementary to the target sequence, is added to the mixture.
3. **DNA Synthesis**: DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the primer, incorporating dideoxynucleotides at random points.
4. **Chain Termination**: When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated, the DNA synthesis is terminated, resulting in DNA fragments of varying lengths.
5. **Electrophoresis**: The DNA fragments are separated by size using gel electrophoresis.
6. **Readout**: The sequence is read from the electropherogram, with each peak corresponding to a specific nucleotide.

The Sanger sequencing method is still widely used today, particularly for small-scale sequencing projects, due to its simplicity and relatively low cost.
