Question:
How is the weighted average grade calculated, and which courses are excluded from this calculation?

Answer:
Calculating the Weighted Average Grade
=====================================

The weighted average grade is calculated using the following formula:

weighted average grade = ∑ (o i \* p i) / ∑ p i

where:
- o i is the grade for a given subject
- p i is the number of ECTS credits assigned to a given subject

Courses Excluded from Calculation
---------------------------------

Courses that are excluded from this calculation are those that were not assigned ECTS credits or were passed without a grade.
