Question:
Under what specific conditions may a student be removed from the student register for lack of progress in studies, according to §26?

Answer:
According to the provided Knowledge Base, there is no specific information regarding §26. However, we can look at the information provided in §23 and §21 to understand the conditions under which a student may be removed from the student register.

§23, paragraph 1 states that "In order to be admitted to the diploma examination it is a prerequisite to complete all the semesters in the field of study." This implies that if a student fails to complete all the semesters in their field of study, they may not be eligible to take the diploma examination.

§21, paragraph 12 states that "A student who has been registered for a diploma semester of second-cycle studies but does not submit a diploma thesis on time shall be removed from the student register, within the deadline provided for in these rules." This suggests that if a student fails to submit their diploma thesis on time, they may be removed from the student register.

However, it is not explicitly stated in the provided Knowledge Base that a student may be removed from the student register for lack of progress in studies under §26.
