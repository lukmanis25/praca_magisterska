Question:
Describe the structure and complementary base pairing of DNA.

Answer:
**DNA Structure and Complementary Base Pairing**
=====================================================

The DNA double helix is a twisted ladder-like structure composed of two anti-parallel strands. Each strand is made up of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. The nucleotides are linked together by phosphodiester bonds, forming the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule.

**Complementary Base Pairing**
-----------------------------

The nitrogenous bases are stacked inside the sugar-phosphate backbone, and they pair with each other through hydrogen bonds. The base pairing is specific and follows the rules:

* Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds.
* Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) through three hydrogen bonds.

This complementary base pairing is crucial for the stability and replication of DNA.

**Key Features of DNA Structure**
---------------------------------

* The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm.
* Each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm.
* Ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix.
* The twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves.
