Question:

| --- | --- |
| c | arithmetic mean |
| 3.00 ≤ c < 3.25 | satisfactory |
| 3.25 ≤ c < 3.75 | satisfactory plus |
| 3.75 ≤ c < 4.25 | good |
| 4.25 ≤ c | very good |

**Courses Excluded from Calculation**

However, it is mentioned that the condition for completing studies and obtaining the diploma of completion of studies is: obtaining the learning outcomes and the number of ECTS points specified in the curriculum, passing the diploma examination, and positive evaluation of the diploma thesis in the case of master's degree and uniform master's studies.
