Question:
How is the final result of master’s degree studies calculated, and what are the corresponding grade categories based on the calculated score?

Answer:
**Final Result Calculation for Master's Degree Studies**
===========================================================

According to § 25, the final result of master's degree studies is calculated using the following formula:

w = 0.6a + 0.3b + 0.1c

where:
- a is the final weighted grade average in accordance with the rules stipulated in §16,
- b is a positive grade for the diploma thesis,
- c is a positive grade for the diploma examination.

**Grade Categories Based on Calculated Score**
=============================================

The final result of studies (w) is entered in the diploma in accordance with the following credit scale:

*   **Very Good**: w ≥ 4.50
*   **Good Plus**: 4.10 ≤ w < 4.50
*   **Good**: 3.70 ≤ w < 4.10
*   **Satisfactory Plus**: 3.30 ≤ w < 3.70
*   **Satisfactory**: 3.00 ≤ w < 3.30

**Additional Information**
-------------------------

In justified cases, the diploma examination committee may raise the final grade calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3 by half a grade.
