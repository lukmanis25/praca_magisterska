Question:
Under what circumstances can classes from the study program planned in Polish be conducted in a foreign language?

Answer:
Based on the Knowledge Base, there is no specific information provided regarding the circumstances under which classes from the study program planned in Polish can be conducted in a foreign language. However, it is mentioned in the study rules that students may change their field of study after completing a semester, and in certain cases, students may be exempted from having to attend subjects they have already completed before commencing their studies, provided that these subjects are listed in the study plan, and that the academic teacher in charge of the subject decides the already attained learning outcomes to be sufficient.

Additionally, it is mentioned that students pursuing individual study plans or curriculums are obliged to follow Study Rules, including the deadlines specific to their study plans. However, there is no explicit information provided regarding the language of instruction for classes conducted in a foreign language.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question based on the provided Knowledge Base.
