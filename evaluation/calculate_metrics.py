        The weighted average grade is calculated using the following formula:

        weighted average grade = âˆ‘ o p / âˆ‘ p i

        where:

        * o i is the grade for a given subject
        * p i is the number of ECTS credits assigned to a given subject

        The courses that are excluded from this calculation are those that were not assigned ECTS credits or were passed without a grade.

        According to the rules, the weighted average of the grades for the semester is calculated taking into account the grades in all subjects. Missing grades in subjects result in no weighted average for a given semester.
