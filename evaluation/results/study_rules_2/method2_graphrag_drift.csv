### Moja PG System's Role in Confirming Learning Outcomes

The university's Moja PG system plays a crucial role in supporting the procedures for confirming learning outcomes as a method of undertaking studies at Gdańsk University of Technology. According to the rules, an individual student account in the 'Moja PG' system contains information on the student's course of studies and current status [Data: Sources (15, 16)].

The system allows for the confirmation of learning outcomes, which is a procedure that enables students to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and social competence obtained outside the education or study system [Data: Sources (1, 5)].

This confirmation process is facilitated by the Moja PG system, which provides a platform for students to upload and store their learning outcomes, as well as for academic teachers to verify and award credits [Data: Sources (7, 23)].

In this way, the Moja PG system supports the university's procedures for confirming learning outcomes, making it easier for students to demonstrate their prior learning and for academic teachers to recognize and validate their achievements [Data: Sources (2, 7)].

### Faculty Board's Role in Diploma Examination Rules

The university's Faculty Board plays a crucial role in ensuring that diploma examination rules are followed. According to § 2 of the rules, the Faculty Board is responsible for establishing the details of the examination in compliance with the faculty rules, confirmed by the faculty board after consultation with Gdańsk Tech Student Government at the faculty [Data: Sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)]+more.

This suggests that the Faculty Board is involved in the decision-making process regarding the diploma examination rules and procedures. Additionally, § 3 states that the chairperson of the diploma examination committee should be the dean or an academic teacher who holds the title of a professor, or a university professor [Data: Sources (4, 5, 6, 7, 8)]+more.

### Communication of Diploma Examination Rules

The Faculty Board ensures that the diploma examination rules are communicated effectively to students and other stakeholders through various channels. According to § 23, students are informed of the date and time of the diploma examination through their individual 'Moja PG' account, at least seven days before the examination is due to take place [Data: Sources (15, 16)].

This suggests that the Faculty Board utilizes digital platforms to disseminate information to students. Additionally, the rules specify that information regarding an open diploma examination shall be posted on the faculty internet site not later than seven days before the examination is due to take place [Data: Sources (15, 16)].

### Implications for Credit Transfer and Accumulation Policies

The Moja PG system's procedures for confirming learning outcomes may have significant implications for the university's credit transfer and accumulation policies, particularly in cases where students are changing their field of study, transferring credits, or returning from a leave [Data: Sources (4)].

According to the rules, students who return from a leave may be requested by the dean to compensate for differences in curriculum resulting from changes that occurred in the study program during the leave [Data: Sources (11)].

This implies that the Moja PG system's procedures for confirming learning outcomes may have an impact on the university's credit transfer and accumulation policies, particularly in cases where students have been away from the university for an extended period and need to catch up on changes to the curriculum [Data: Sources (4)].

In conclusion, previously completed subjects by secondary school students can be recognized or exempted when they apply for studies at Gdańsk University of Technology under certain conditions. Students must have completed the subjects in question within the last 14 days of the adoption of a given study program and must have provided the required documentation. The recognition and exemption of previously completed subjects can have implications for students' academic and financial situations.","As per §34(3–4), recognition or exemption of subjects completed by secondary school students at Gdańsk University of Technology depends on whether the students apply to the same or a different field of study. If they apply to the same field, they may be exempted from repeating the same subjects, provided the learning outcomes remain unchanged, with the final decision made by the academic teacher responsible for the subject. If they apply to a different field, exemption is possible if the previously completed subjects are part of the new study plan and the academic teacher confirms that the learning outcomes already achieved are sufficient. These conditions are clearly defined and restricted to the institutional standards set by the university.",0.38000128795940047,0.9428802889213888,0.21,0.29,0.8000051518376016
