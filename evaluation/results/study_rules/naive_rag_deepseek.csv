"Under what circumstances may classes at Gdańsk University of Technology be conducted in a foreign language, and how is the language of examination determined in such cases?","**Language of Instruction and Examination at Gdańsk University of Technology**

According to the provided document chunks, the language of instruction and examination at Gdańsk University of Technology is not explicitly stated for all cases. However, we can infer some information from the following points:

*   **Language of instruction**: The document mentions that students may complete part of their study program at other universities, including foreign universities, and students from other universities may complete part of their study at Gdańsk University of Technology, pursuant to bilateral contracts between universities. This implies that classes may be conducted in a foreign language in cases where international students are involved or when students are studying abroad.
*   **Language of examination**: The document does not provide specific information on how the language of examination is determined in cases where classes are conducted in a foreign language. However, it can be inferred that the language of examination may be the same as the language of instruction, as there is no mention of a separate language for examination.

In summary, while the document does not provide explicit information on the language of instruction and examination, it can be inferred that classes may be conducted in a foreign language in cases involving international students or study abroad programs. The language of examination may also be the same as the language of instruction in such cases.

In the latter case, the language of examination or course credit is determined through consultation with the Group Representative. Moreover, students may write their diploma thesis in a foreign language with the dean's approval, even if the program is conducted in Polish.

What are the specific categories of students for whom the dean may agree to implement an individual study plan upon receiving a request within 14 days of the semester's start?,"# Individual Study Plan

According to the provided document chunks, there is no mention of specific categories of students for whom the dean may agree to implement an individual study plan upon receiving a request within 14 days of the semester's start.

However, the document does mention that students have the right to have their dignity respected by every member of the academic community, acquire knowledge and skills, and develop their own scientific interests.

To answer the question directly, since the document does not provide the specific categories of students for whom the dean may agree to implement an individual study plan, I must say that the information is not available in the provided document chunks.

If you could provide more context or clarify the question, I would be happy to try and assist further.
