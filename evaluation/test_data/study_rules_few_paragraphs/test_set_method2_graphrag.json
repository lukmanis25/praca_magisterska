For instance, if a student is removed due to poor academic performance, their absence is classified as 'academic suspension.' In contrast, if a student is removed due to disciplinary actions, their absence is classified as 'disciplinary suspension.'\n\n**Disciplinary Actions**\n------------------------\n\nThe university's disciplinary process is outlined in the Study Rules. According to the rules, students can be removed from classes due to disciplinary actions, specifically for violating the rules of student conduct.

    "### Weighted Average Grade Calculation\n\nThe weighted average grade calculation is a process used by Gdańsk University of Technology to evaluate student performance. This calculation takes into account the grades obtained by students in various courses, with each course having a specific weightage. The weighted average grade is calculated by multiplying the grade obtained in each course by its weightage and then summing up the results. The final weighted average grade is obtained by dividing the sum of the weighted grades by the total weightage of all courses.\n\nAccording to § 16 of the provided data, the weighted average grade is calculated using the formula: ∑ o p i / ∑ p i, where o i is the grade for a given subject, and p i is the number of ECTS credits assigned to a given subject [Data: Sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)]+more.\n\n### Excluded Courses\n\nThe courses that are excluded from this calculation are those that are not part of the regular curriculum or those that are taken by students as electives. These courses may include special projects, internships, or research work that are not part of the regular grading system. The exclusion of these courses is necessary to ensure that the weighted average grade accurately reflects the student's performance in the regular curriculum.\n\nAccording to § 16, point 10, in the provided data, courses that were not assigned ECTS credits or were passed without a grade are omitted from the weighted average calculation [Data: Sources (10, 11)]+more. This means that if a student has a course that is not assigned ECTS credits, such as a diploma exam [Data: Sources (8)], or a course that was passed without a grade, the weighted average grade will not be affected by the grade or ECTS credits of that course.\n\n### Impact of Excluded Courses\n\nExcluding certain courses from the weighted average grade calculation can significantly affect the accuracy of the final grade. This exclusion can lead to an inaccurate representation of the student's overall performance, as it does not take into account the grades or ECTS credits of these courses. For example, if a student has a high grade in a course that is not assigned ECTS credits, their weighted average grade may be lower than it would be if the course were included. Similarly, if a student has a low grade in a course that is not assigned ECTS credits, their weighted average grade may be higher than it would be if the course were included.\n\nThis exclusion can have a significant impact on the accuracy of the final grade, particularly if the excluded courses are significant to the student's overall performance."
