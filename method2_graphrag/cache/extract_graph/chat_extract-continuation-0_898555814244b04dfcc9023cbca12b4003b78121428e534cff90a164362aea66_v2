The growing chain terminates when a ddNTP is incorporated, resulting in daughter strands of different lengths. The right part of this image shows the separation of the DNA fragments on the basis of size. Each ddNTP is fluorescently labeled with a different color so that the sequence can be read by the size of each fragment and its color. \nFigure  17.3.2\n : Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method is illustrated. Using dideoxynucleotides, the DNA fragment can be terminated at different points. The DNA is separated on the basis of size, and these bands, based on the size of the fragments, can be read.\nEarly Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing\nIn shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments are then sequenced using the chain-sequencing method. Then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences overlap. By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire DNA sequence can be reformed. A larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy, consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear. The person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy. The person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller pieces you see a mountain. In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun sequencing.\n\nOriginally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. However, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double-barrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap. Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information.\n\nNext-generation Sequencing\nSince 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order.\n\nEvolution Connection: Comparing Sequences\n\nA sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures. Sequence alignments may be used to construct phylogenetic trees. The following website uses a software program called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool).\n\nUnder “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.” Input the following sequence into the large \"query sequence\" box: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA. Below the box, locate the \"Species\" field and type \"human\" or \"Homo sapiens\". Then click “BLAST” to compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome. The result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on \"Graphics\". This will bring you to a page that shows where the sequence is found within the entire human genome. You can move the slider that looks like a green flag back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected sequence by clicking the \"ATG\" button.\n\nUse of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms\nThe first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was accomplished by Fred Sanger using shotgun sequencing. Several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced. The first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae; this was accomplished by Craig Venter in the 1980s. Approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been sequenced. By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and humans Homo\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>FREDERICK SANGER<|>PERSON<|>Frederick Sanger is a scientist who developed the dideoxy chain termination method)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>PERSON<|>Craig Venter is a scientist who sequenced the genome of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium whose genome was sequenced by Craig Venter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast whose genome was sequenced by multiple laboratories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESCHERICHIA COLI K12<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Escherichia coli K12 is a bacterium whose genome was sequenced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUS MUSCULUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mus musculus is a mouse whose genome was sequenced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Drosophila melanogaster is a fruit fly whose genome was sequenced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caenorhabditis elegans is a nematode whose genome was sequenced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOMO SAPIENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Homo sapiens is a human whose genome was sequenced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BACTERIOPHAGE FX174<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bacteriophage fx174 is a bacterial virus whose genome was sequenced by Frederick Sanger)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREDERICK SANGER<|>BACTERIOPHAGE FX174<|>Frederick Sanger sequenced the genome of bacteriophage fx174<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE<|>Craig Venter sequenced the genome of Haemophilus influenzae<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>Craig Venter contributed to the sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESCHERICHIA COLI K12<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>Craig Venter contributed to the sequencing of Escherichia coli K12<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUS MUSCULUS<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>Craig Venter contributed to the sequencing of Mus musculus<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>Craig Venter contributed to the sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>Craig Venter contributed to the sequencing of Caenorhabditis elegans<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOMO SAPIENS<|>CRAIG VENTER<|>Craig Venter contributed to the sequencing of Homo sapiens<|>2)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
