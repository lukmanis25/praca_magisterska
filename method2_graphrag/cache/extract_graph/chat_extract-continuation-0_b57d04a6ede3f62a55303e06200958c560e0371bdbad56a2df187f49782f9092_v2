Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa.\n\nSummary\nDNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base. In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is removed along with a few bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase. The ends of the newly synthesized fragment are attached to the rest of the DNA using DNA ligase, which creates a phosphodiester bond.\n\nMost mistakes are corrected, and if they are not, they may result in a mutation defined as a permanent change in the DNA sequence. Mutations can be of many types, such as substitution, deletion, insertion, and translocation. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences such as cancer. Mutations can be induced or may occur spontaneously.\n\n15: Genes and Proteins\n\nSince the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation. Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes. Genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell. Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it.\n\n15.0: Prelude to Genes and Proteins\n\nSince the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation. Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes. Genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell.\n\nMolecular models show a DNA double helix that is packed in a chromosome in Part a, and two proteins are shown in Parts b and c.\nFigure  15.0.1\n : Genes, which are carried on (a) chromosomes, are linearly organized instructions for making the RNA and protein molecules that are necessary for all of the processes of life. The (b) interleukin-2 protein and (c) alpha-2u-globulin protein are just two examples of the array of different molecular structures that are encoded by genes.

Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes. Genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell. Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it.\n\n15.1: The Genetic Code\n\nThe cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters. Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon.\n\nThe cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G, and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (Figure  15.1.1\n ). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.\n\nStructures of the twenty amino acids are given. Six amino acids—glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine—are non-polar and aliphatic, meaning they do not have a ring. Six amino acids—serine, threonine, cysteine, proline\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA POLYMERASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DNA polymerase is an enzyme that makes mistakes while adding nucleotides and edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENDEL<|>PERSON<|>Mendel's work was rediscovered in 1900 and led to the definition of the gene as a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Human Genome Research Institute is an organization that provided credit for a chromosome image)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAMIN HERATI<|>PERSON<|>Ramin Herati is a person who created an image of interleukin-2 protein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARREN LOGAN<|>PERSON<|>Darren Logan is a person who rendered an image of alpha-2u-globulin protein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERLEUKIN-2<|>GEO<|>Interleukin-2 is a protein molecule encoded by genes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALPHA-2U-GLOBULIN<|>GEO<|>Alpha-2u-globulin is a protein molecule encoded by genes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHROMOSOME<|>GEO<|>Chromosomes are linearly arranged DNA molecules that carry genes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENE<|>EVENT<|>Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes, specifying sequences of amino acids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTEIN<|>EVENT<|>Proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA POLYMERASE<|>GENE<|>DNA polymerase makes mistakes while adding nucleotides to genes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENDEL<|>GENE<|>Mendel's work led to the definition of the gene as a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE<|>CHROMOSOME<|>National Human Genome Research Institute provided credit for a chromosome image<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAMIN HERATI<|>INTERLEUKIN-2<|>Ramin Herati created an image of interleukin-2 protein<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DARREN LOGAN<|>ALPHA-2U-GLOBULIN<|>Darren Logan rendered an image of alpha-2u-globulin protein<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENE<|>CHROMOSOME<|>Genes are composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENE<|>PROTEIN<|>Genes specify sequences of amino acids that make up proteins<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTEIN<|>CELL<|>Proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell<|>9)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
