Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.\n\nTumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer\nIn normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor suppressor genes in cells. The most studied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself functions as a transcription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.\n\nProto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer. Overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes can alter transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat.\n\nCancer and Epigenetic Alterations\nSilencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes. In cancer cells, the DNA in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands. Histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells. This combination of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer. When these modifications occur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced. Increasingly, scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer. Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed—for example, by preventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in DNA—it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these processes. Indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.\n\nGenes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge.\n\nCancer and Transcriptional Control\nAlterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. Mutations that activate transcription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding site in a promoter. This could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth. Alternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor. This could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells.\n\nResearchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying how a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and new ways to treat cancer. In breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. One such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many protein kinases that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.\n\nCancer and Post-transcriptional Control\nChanges in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have shown that specific cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of RNA molecules to degrade them, overexpression of these miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many miRNAs could dramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a change in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This suggests that alterations in miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some miRNAs are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new drugs that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer.\n\nCancer and Translational/Post-translational Control\nThere are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications are found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphory\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>P53<|>GENE<|>P53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYC<|>GENE<|>Myc is an oncogene involved in cancer, specifically in Burkett’s Lymphoma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGFR<|>GENE<|>Epidermal growth factor receptor is a protein that is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURKETT’S LYMPHOMA<|>EVENT<|>A cancer of the lymph system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAST CANCER<|>EVENT<|>A type of cancer that can be treated with drugs that prevent the activation of EGFR)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTISM<|>EVENT<|>A disease thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLERGIES<|>EVENT<|>A disease thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFLAMMATION<|>EVENT<|>A disease thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P53<|>CANCER<|>P53 is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYC<|>BURKETT’S LYMPHOMA<|>Myc is aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGFR<|>BREAST CANCER<|>EGFR is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P53<|>TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES<|>P53 is a tumor suppressor gene<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYC<|>ONCOGENES<|>Myc is an oncogene<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGFR<|>TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL<|>EGFR activates many protein kinases that activate transcription factors<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIRNAs<|>BREAST CANCER<|>Altered expression of miRNAs is found in breast cancer cells<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIRNAs<|>LUNG CANCER<|>Altered expression of miRNAs is found in lung cancer cells<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS<|>CANCER<|>Epigenetic alterations are common in cancer cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL<|>CANCER<|>Alterations in transcriptional control can lead to cancer<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL<|>CANCER<|>Alterations in post-transcriptional control can lead to cancer<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSLATIONAL/POST-TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL<|>CANCER<|>Alterations in translational/post-translational control can lead to cancer<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
