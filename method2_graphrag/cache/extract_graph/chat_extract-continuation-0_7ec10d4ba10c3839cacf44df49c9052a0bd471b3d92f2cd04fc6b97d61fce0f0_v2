This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.\n\nThe leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides. The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.\n\nOnce the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies move into two different cells during cell division. The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows.\n\nDNA replication steps\n\nDNA unwinds at the origin of replication.\nHelicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally.\nSingle-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.\nTopoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.\nPrimase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.\nDNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer.\nElongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.\nRNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.\nGaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.\nThe gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.\nTable  14.4.1\n  summarizes the enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication and the functions of each.\n\nTable  14.4.1\n : Prokaryotic DNA Replication: Enzymes and Their Function\nEnzyme/protein\tSpecific Function\nDNA pol I\tExonuclease activity removes RNA primer and replaces with newly synthesized DNA\nDNA pol II\tRepair function\nDNA pol III\tMain enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction\nHelicase\tOpens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases\nLigase\tSeals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA strand\nPrimase\tSynthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication\nSliding Clamp\tHelps to hold the DNA polymerase in place when nucleotides are being added\nTopoisomerase\tHelps relieve the stress on DNA when unwinding by causing breaks and then resealing the DNA\nSingle-strand binding proteins (SSB)\tBinds to single-stranded DNA to avoid DNA rewinding back.\n\nSummary\nReplication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome called the origin of replication—the point at which the DNA opens up. Helicase opens up the DNA double helix, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded DNA near the replication fork to keep the fork open. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with DNA ligase, which creates phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-OH of one end and the 5' phosphate of the other strand.\n\n14.5: DNA Replication in Eukaryotes\n\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication.\n\nEukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes.

There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication.
