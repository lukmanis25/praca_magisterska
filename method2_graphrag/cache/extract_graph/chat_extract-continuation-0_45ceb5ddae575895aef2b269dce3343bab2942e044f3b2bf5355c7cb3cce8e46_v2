So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.\n\nEukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus (Figure  14.2.7\n ). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer. The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure. This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. At the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.\n\nIn interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.\n\nIllustration shows the levels of organization of eukaryotic chromosomes, starting with the DNA double helix, which wraps around histone proteins. The entire DNA molecule wraps around many clusters of histone proteins, forming a structure that looks like beads on a string. The chromatin is further condensed by wrapping around a protein core. The result is a compact chromosome, shown in duplicated form.\nFigure  14.2.7\n : These figures illustrate the compaction of the eukaryotic chromosome.\nSummary\nThe currently accepted model of the double-helix structure of DNA was proposed by Watson and Crick. Some of the salient features are that the two strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel in nature. Deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the structure, and the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. The diameter of the double helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. A purine always pairs with a pyrimidine; A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. One turn of the helix has ten base pairs. During cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of the DNA by a process known as DNA replication. Prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome. In general, eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear DNA molecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different states of packaging and compaction.\n\n14.3: Basics of DNA Replication\n\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested: conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\n\nThe elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (Figure  14.3.1\n ): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.\n\nIllustration shows the conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive models of DNA synthesis. In the conservative model, when DNA is replicated and both newly synthesized strands are paired together. In the semi-conservative model, each newly synthesized strand pairs with a parent strand. In the dispersive model, newly synthesized DNA is interspersed with parent DNA within both DNA strands.\nFigure  14.3.1\n : The three suggested models of DNA replication. Grey indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA\nIn conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. In the dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.\n\nMeselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the DNA (Figure  14.3.2\n ).\n\nIllustration shows\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>E.COLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>E. coli is a type of prokaryote with a genome size of 4.6 million base pairs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATSON<|>PERSON<|>Watson is a person who proposed the double-helix structure of DNA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRICK<|>PERSON<|>Crick is a person who proposed the double-helix structure of DNA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MESSELSON<|>PERSON<|>Meselson is a person who studied DNA replication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAHl<|>PERSON<|>Stahl is a person who studied DNA replication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUkARYOTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eukaryotes are organisms with linear DNA molecules packaged into nucleosomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROKARYOTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Prokaryotes are organisms with circular chromosomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA<|>EVENT<|>DNA is a molecule that replicates and makes copies of itself)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTONES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form nucleosomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUCLEOSOMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nucleosomes are structures formed by DNA wrapping around histones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHROMOSOMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chromosomes are linear DNA molecules packaged into nucleosomes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E.COLI<|>WATSON<|>E. coli's genome structure was studied by Watson and Crick<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WATSON<|>CRICK<|>Watson and Crick proposed the double-helix structure of DNA<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MESSELSON<|>STAHl<|>Meselson and Stahl studied DNA replication together<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E.COLI<|>MESSELSON<|>Meselson and Stahl used E. coli to study DNA replication<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA<|>HISTONES<|>DNA wraps around histones to form nucleosomes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NUCLEOSOMES<|>CHROMOSOMES<|>Nucleosomes are part of the structure of chromosomes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUkARYOTES<|>CHROMOSOMES<|>Eukaryotes have linear DNA molecules packaged into nucleosomes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROKARYOTES<|>E.COLI<|>E. coli is a type of prokaryote<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
