Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.\n\nSummary\nImagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it is being used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also being applied to developments such as the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.\n\nArt Connections\nFigure  17.4.1\n : In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think? Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?\n\nAnswer\nThere are no right or wrong answers to these questions. While it is true that prostate cancer treatment itself can be harmful, many men would rather be aware that they have cancer so they can monitor the disease and begin treatment if it progresses. And while genetic screening may be useful, it is expensive and may cause needless worry. People with certain risk factors may never develop the disease, and preventative treatments may do more harm than good.\n\n17.5: Genomics and Proteomics\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins.\n\nProteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.\n\nA proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a step in the right direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics. Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes. Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. There are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.\n\nMetabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism. The metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism. Metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors. The goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the metabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms.\n\nBasic Techniques in Protein Analysis\nThe ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis. The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. Advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small samples of protein. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>GENOMICS IN AGRICULTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Genomics in Agriculture is an organization that applies genomics to improve crop yields>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES PREVENTATIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United States Preventative Services Task Force is a organization that recommends against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PCA3<|>EVENT<|>PCA3 is a test considered to be more accurate than the PSA test for screening prostate cancer>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSA<|>EVENT<|>PSA is a test used to screen healthy men for prostate cancer>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where the United States Preventative Services Task Force is based>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEMOGLOBIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hemoglobin is a transport protein that helps transport oxygen to various organs>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENOMICS IN AGRICULTURE<|>UNITED STATES<|>Genomics in Agriculture is an organization based in the United States<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES PREVENTATIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE<|>PCA3<|>The United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends the PCA3 test as a more accurate alternative to the PSA test<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES PREVENTATIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE<|>PSA<|>The United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEMOGLOBIN<|>GENOMICS IN AGRICULTURE<|>Hemoglobin is a protein studied in genomics and proteomics, which is applied to improve crop yields in agriculture<|>2)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
