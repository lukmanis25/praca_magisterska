What impact do you think this might have on protein synthesis?\n\nChemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity\nProteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane.\n\nChemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. These changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—all resulting in changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).\n\nThe addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded (Figure 16.6.2\n). One way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.\n\nMultiple ubiquitin groups bind to a protein. The tagged protein is then fed into the hollow tube of a proteasome. The proteasome degrades the protein.\nFigure 16.6.2\n: Proteins with ubiquitin tags are marked for degradation within the proteasome.\nSummary\nChanging the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein, the function of the protein, or how long it is found in the cell. To translate the protein, a protein initiator complex must assemble on the RNA. Modifications (such as phosphorylation) of proteins in this complex can prevent proper translation from occurring. Once a protein has been synthesized, it can be modified (phosphorylated, acetylated, methylated, or ubiquitinated). These post-translational modifications can greatly impact the stability, degradation, or function of the protein.\n\n16.7: Cancer and Gene Regulation\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\n\nCancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.\n\nFor cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function. As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer.\n\nCancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression\nCancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation).\n\nChanges in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be detected in cancer. While these changes don’t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells. Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.\n\nTumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer\nIn normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells to prevent\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ALZHEIMER'S<|>DISEASE<|>A neurodegenerative disease associated with increased phosphorylation levels of eIF-2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARKINSON'S<|>DISEASE<|>A neurodegenerative disease associated with increased phosphorylation levels of eIF-2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNTINGTON'S<|>DISEASE<|>A neurodegenerative disease associated with increased phosphorylation levels of eIF-2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EIF-2<|>PROTEIN<|>A protein involved in translation initiation complex)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTEASOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organelle that functions to remove proteins marked for degradation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYCLIN B<|>PROTEIN<|>A protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER<|>DISEASE<|>A disease of altered gene expression)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EIF-2<|>ALZHEIMER'S<|>Increased phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 are associated with Alzheimer's disease<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EIF-2<|>PARKINSON'S<|>Increased phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 are associated with Parkinson's disease<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EIF-2<|>HUNTINGTON'S<|>Increased phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 are associated with Huntington's disease<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYCLIN B<|>CANCER<|>Increased phosphorylation of cyclin B contributes to the development of cancer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROTEASOME<|>CANCER<|>Proteasome is involved in protein degradation, which is altered in cancer cells<|>2)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
