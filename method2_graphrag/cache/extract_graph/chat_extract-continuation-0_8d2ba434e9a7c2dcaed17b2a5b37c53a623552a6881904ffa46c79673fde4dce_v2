In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.\n\nThe top illustration shows a replicated DNA strand with G-T base mismatch. The bottom illustration shows the repaired DNA, which has the correct G-C base pairing.\nFigure  14.6.2\n : In mismatch repair, the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base.\nIn another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base (Figure  14.6.3\n ). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.\n\nIllustration shows a DNA strand in which a thymine dimer has formed. Excision repair enzymes cut out the section of DNA that contains the dimer so it can be replaced with normal base pairs.\nFigure  14.6.3\n : Nucleotide excision repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other can form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced.\nA well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa (Figure  14.6.4\n ). Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication. People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who dont have the condition.\n\nPhoto shows a person with mottled skin lesions that result from xeroderma pigmentosa.\nFigure  14.6.4\n : Xeroderma pigmentosa is a condition in which thymine dimerization from exposure to UV is not repaired. Exposure to sunlight results in skin lesions. (credit: James Halpern et al.)\nErrors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body.\n\nMutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in Figure  14.6.5\n .\n\nIllustration shows different types of point mutations that result from a single amino acid substitution. In a silent mutation, no change in the amino acid sequence occurs. In a missense mutation, one amino acid is substituted for another. In a nonsense mutation, a stop codon is substituted for an amino acid. In a frameshift mutation, one or more bases is added or deleted, resulting in a change in the reading frame.\nFigure  14.6.5\n : Mutations can lead to changes in the protein sequence encoded by the DNA.\nExercise  14.6.1\n \n\nA frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is often less deleterious than a mutation that results in the insertion of one nucleotide. Why?\n\nAnswer\nIf three nucleotides are added, one additional amino acid will be incorporated into the protein chain, but the reading frame won't shift.\n\nMutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DNA is a molecule that contains genetic information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUkARYOTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a true nucleus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPLICATION PROTEINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Proteins involved in the process of DNA replication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Proteins that detect and correct mismatched bases in DNA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR<|>EVENT<|>A type of repair mechanism that corrects DNA damage caused by UV exposure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XERODERMA PIGMENTOSA<|>EVENT<|>A genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV radiation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UV RAYS<|>EVENT<|>A type of electromagnetic radiation that can cause DNA damage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYMINE DIMERS<|>EVENT<|>A type of DNA damage caused by UV radiation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA POL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An enzyme involved in DNA repair)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA LIGASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An enzyme that seals gaps in DNA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES HALPERN<|>PERSON<|>A researcher who studied xeroderma pigmentosa)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA<|>EUkARYOTES<|>DNA is found in eukaryotic cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REPLICATION PROTEINS<|>DNA<|>Replication proteins are involved in DNA replication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS<|>DNA<|>Mismatch repair proteins correct errors in DNA replication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR<|>DNA<|>Nucleotide excision repair corrects DNA damage caused by UV radiation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XERODERMA PIGMENTOSA<|>UV RAYS<|>Xeroderma pigmentosa is caused by UV radiation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THYMINE DIMERS<|>UV RAYS<|>Thymine dimers are caused by UV radiation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA POL<|>NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR<|>DNA pol is involved in nucleotide excision repair<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA LIGASE<|>NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR<|>DNA ligase is involved in nucleotide excision repair<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES HALPERN<|>XERODERMA PIGMENTOSA<|>James Halpern studied xeroderma pigmentosa<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
