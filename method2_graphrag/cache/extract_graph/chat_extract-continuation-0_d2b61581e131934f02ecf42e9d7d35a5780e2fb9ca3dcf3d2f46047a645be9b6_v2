A 5' cap and 3' poly-A tail are also added.\nA scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome. Would you expect the bacteria to transcribe the gene?\n\nThe mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (ATTTGCAT). These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more “active” genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell.\n\nTranscription Factors for RNA Polymerase II\nThe complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters. An army of basal transcription factors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed. Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase II for transcription initiation.\n\nThe names of the basal transcription factors begin with “TFII” (this is the transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and are specified with the letters A–J. The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the DNA template, with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.\n\nThe processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template involve slightly less complex collections of transcription factors, but the general theme is the same. Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein synthesis.\n\nEvolution Connection: The Evolution of Promoters\n\nThe evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in genes during DNA replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that gene’s promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression.\n\nScientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.\n\nIt is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher organisms. However, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.1\n\nPromoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III\nIn eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves.\n\nEukaryotic Elongation and Termination\nFollowing the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.\n\nAlthough the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is more complex. When eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA and proteins called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA–histone complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight histones like thread\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE II<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RNA polymerase II is an enzyme that transcribes eukaryotic genes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUkARYOTE<|>GEO<|>Eukaryote is a type of cell that has a nucleus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROKARYOTE<|>GEO<|>Prokaryote is a type of cell that lacks a nucleus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUSE<|>GEO<|>Mouse is an organism with a genome that includes genes and pseudogenes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENTIST<|>PERSON<|>A scientist is a person who conducts experiments and research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>GEO<|>Cell is a basic unit of life that can transcribe and translate genes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gene is a unit of heredity that can be transcribed and translated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSEUDOGENE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pseudogene is a gene that has lost its protein-coding ability or is no longer expressed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYMIDINE KINASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thymidine kinase is an enzyme that is encoded by a gene)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transcription factor is a protein that regulates gene expression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE I<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RNA polymerase I is an enzyme that transcribes genes in eukaryotes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE III<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RNA polymerase III is an enzyme that transcribes genes in eukaryotes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHROMATIN<|>GEO<|>Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins in eukaryotic cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Histone is a protein that DNA wraps around in chromatin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUCLEOSOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nucleosome is a complex of DNA and histones in chromatin)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE II<|>EUkARYOTE<|>RNA polymerase II transcribes genes in eukaryotes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCIENTIST<|>GENE<|>A scientist can manipulate genes in experiments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOUSE<|>GENE<|>The mouse genome includes genes and pseudogenes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THYMIDINE KINASE<|>GENE<|>Thymidine kinase is encoded by a gene<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR<|>GENE<|>Transcription factors regulate gene expression<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE I<|>GENE<|>RNA polymerase I transcribes genes in eukaryotes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE III<|>GENE<|>RNA polymerase III transcribes genes in eukaryotes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHROMATIN<|>EUkARYOTE<|>Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins in eukaryotic cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTONE<|>CHROMATIN<|>Histone is a protein that DNA wraps around in chromatin<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NUCLEOSOME<|>CHROMATIN<|>Nucleosome is a complex of DNA and histones in chromatin<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
