Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.\n\nStructures of the twenty amino acids are given. Six amino acids—glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, methionine, and isoleucine—are non-polar and aliphatic, meaning they do not have a ring. Six amino acids—serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, asparagine, and glutamate—are polar but uncharged. Three amino acids—lysine, arginine, and histidine—are positively charged. Two amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, are negatively charged. Three amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—are nonpolar and aromatic.\nFigure  15.1.1\n : Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino group ( NH+3\n ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or charged, as well as large or small. It is the variety of amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible variation of protein structure and function.\nThe Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein\nThe flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the Central Dogma (Figure  15.1.2\n ), which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.\n\nTo make a protein, genetic information encoded by the DNA must be transcribed onto an mRNA molecule. The RNA is then processed by splicing to remove exons and by the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. A ribosome then reads the sequence on the mRNA, and uses this information to string amino acids into a protein.\nFigure  15.1.2\n : Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto messenger RNA. Ribosomes are able to read the genetic information inscribed on a strand of messenger RNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein.\nThe Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal\nGiven the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called codons. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (Figure  15.1.4\n ). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.\n\nScientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified (Figure  15.1.3\n ).\n\nFigure shows all 64 codons. Sixty-two of these code for amino acids, and three are stop codons.\nFigure  15.1.3\n : This figure shows the genetic code for translating each nucleotide triplet in mRNA into an amino acid or a termination signal in a nascent protein. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nIn addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.\n\nThe genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DNA is the genetic material that encodes RNA and proteins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RNA is the molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to proteins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTEIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Proteins are the final products of gene expression, performing various cellular functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCIS CRICK<|>PERSON<|>Francis Crick is a scientist who contributed to the discovery of the genetic code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYDNEY BRENNER<|>PERSON<|>Sydney Brenner is a scientist who contributed to the discovery of the genetic code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NIH is a research institution that contributed to the discovery of the genetic code)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA<|>RNA<|>DNA encodes RNA, which carries genetic information to proteins<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RNA<|>PROTEIN<|>RNA specifies the sequence of proteins<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCIS CRICK<|>SYDNEY BRENNER<|>Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner collaborated on the discovery of the genetic code<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA<|>FRANCIS CRICK<|>Francis Crick contributed to the discovery of the genetic code, which is encoded in DNA<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA<|>SYDNEY BRENNER<|>Sydney Brenner contributed to the discovery of the genetic code, which is encoded in DNA<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
