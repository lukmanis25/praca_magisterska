The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.\n\nThe genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.\n\nIllustration shows a frameshift mutation in which the reading frame is altered by the deletion of two amino acids.\nFigure  15.1.4\n : The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of an mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether.\nDegeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. This nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional.\n\nScientific Method Connection: Which Has More DNA: A Kiwi or a Strawberry?\n\nPhotographs show a thin slice of a green kiwi fruit and a bowl of strawberries.\nFigure  15.1.5\n : Do you think that a kiwi or a strawberry has more DNA per fruit? (credit “kiwi”: \"Kelbv\"/Flickr; credit: “strawberry”: Alisdair McDiarmid)\nQuestion: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size (Figure  15.1.5\n ) also have approximately the same amount of DNA?\n\nBackground: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell nuclei. Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.\n\nHypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?\n\nTest your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit.\n\nPrepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt. Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).\nGrind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt instrument. Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.\nAdd 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.\nRemove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container.\nPour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. You should observe white, precipitated DNA.\nGather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.\nRecord your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit.\n\nAnalyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your results reproducible?\n\nDraw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? If you had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?\n\nSummary\nThe genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.\n\n15.2: Prokaryotic Transcription\n\nThe prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid. Prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids that are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes.\n\nThe prokaryotes, which include bacteria and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DNA is a molecule that carries genetic information>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>mRNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>mRNA is a molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROTEIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Protein is a molecule synthesized from mRNA during translation>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a protein or functional RNA>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHROMOSOME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chromosome is a thread-like structure made up of DNA and proteins>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIWI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kiwi is a type of fruit that has hexaploid chromosomes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRAWBERRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Strawberry is a type of fruit that has octoploid chromosomes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cell is the basic structural and functional unit of living organisms>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUCLEOID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nucleoid is the central region of a prokaryotic cell where DNA resides>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASMID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plasmid is a small circular DNA molecule that may contain one or a few genes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BACTERIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bacteria are a type of prokaryotic organism>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Archaea are a type of prokaryotic organism>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUkARYOTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eukaryote is a type of organism whose cells have a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Histone is a type of protein that DNA wraps around to form chromosomes>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA<|>GENE<|>DNA contains genes that code for proteins or functional RNA<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENE<|>mRNA<|>Genes are transcribed into mRNA<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>mRNA<|>PROTEIN<|>mRNA is translated into protein<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIWI<|>STRAWBERRY<|>Kiwi and strawberry are both fruits that have different numbers of chromosomes<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELL<|>NUCLEOID<|>The nucleoid is the central region of a prokaryotic cell where DNA resides<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACTERIA<|>ARCHEA<|>Bacteria and archaea are both types of prokaryotic organisms<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUkARYOTE<|>HISTONE<|>Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized around histone proteins<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
