Plasmids with the insert have a disrupted lacZ gene and produce white colonies. Thus, colonies containing the cloned DNA can be selected on the basis of color.\nFigure  17.1.6\n : This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.\nYou are working in a molecular biology lab and, unbeknownst to you, your lab partner left the foreign genomic DNA that you are planning to clone on the lab bench overnight instead of storing it in the freezer. As a result, it was degraded by nucleases, but still used in the experiment. The plasmid, on the other hand, is fine. What results would you expect from your molecular cloning experiment?\n\nThere will be no colonies on the bacterial plate.\nThere will be blue colonies only.\nThere will be blue and white colonies.\nThe will be white colonies only.\n\nCellular Cloning\nUnicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact replica of the genetic material.\n\nReproductive Cloning\nReproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.\n\nParthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.\n\nSexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.\n\nThe first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (Figure 17.1.7). There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). Still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.\n\nArt Connection\n\nTo clone Dolly the sheep, a Scottish Blackface sheep was used as a cytoplasmic donor. Eggs from this sheep were extracted, and the nucleus removed. A Finn-Dorset sheep was used as the nuclear donor. Nuclei were extracted from mammary cells, and direct electric current was used to fuse the nuclear DNA with the donor egg. The egg was then allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage, in which a sphere of cells contains a cluster of cells on one side. The blastocyst was implanted in a surrogate mother, resulting in Dolly the sheep.\nFigure  17.1.7\n : Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be cloned. To create Dolly, the nucleus was removed from a donor egg cell. The nucleus from a second sheep was then introduced into the cell, which was allowed to divide to the blastocyst stage before being implanted in a surrogate mother.

The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.\n\nGene Targeting\nAlthough classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>X-GAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>X-gal is a dye used in molecular cloning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LAB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A laboratory where molecular cloning experiments are conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELLULAR CLONING<|>EVENT<|>A process of cloning unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPRODUCTIVE CLONING<|>EVENT<|>A method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTHENOGENESIS<|>EVENT<|>A form of asexual reproduction where an embryo grows and develops without fertilization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOLLY<|>PERSON<|>The first cloned animal, a sheep born in 1996)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH BLACKFACE SHEEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A breed of sheep used as a cytoplasmic donor in cloning Dolly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINN-DORSET SHEEP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A breed of sheep used as a nuclear donor in cloning Dolly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENETIC ENGINEERING<|>EVENT<|>The alteration of an organism's genotype using recombinant DNA technology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organism that receives recombinant DNA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUNDUP-READY SOYBEANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A genetically modified organism used in food production)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BORER-RESISTANT CORN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A genetically modified organism used in food production)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>X-GAL<|>MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LAB<|>X-gal is used in molecular cloning experiments in the lab<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELLULAR CLONING<|>REPRODUCTIVE CLONING<|>Cellular cloning is a type of reproductive cloning<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOLLY<|>SCOTTISH BLACKFACE SHEEP<|>Dolly was cloned using a Scottish Blackface sheep as a cytoplasmic donor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOLLY<|>FINN-DORSET SHEEP<|>Dolly was cloned using a Finn-Dorset sheep as a nuclear donor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENETIC ENGINEERING<|>GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISM<|>Genetic engineering produces genetically modified organisms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROUNDUP-READY SOYBEANS<|>GENETIC ENGINEERING<|>Roundup-ready soybeans are a product of genetic engineering<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BORER-RESISTANT CORN<|>GENETIC ENGINEERING<|>Borer-resistant corn is a product of genetic engineering<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
