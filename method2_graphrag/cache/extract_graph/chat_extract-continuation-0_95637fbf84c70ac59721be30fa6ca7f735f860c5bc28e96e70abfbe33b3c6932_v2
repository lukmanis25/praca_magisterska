When unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.\n\nThe DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very specific regions called CpG islands. These are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in the promoter regions of genes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region. Highly methylated (hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive.\n\nIllustration shows a chromosome that is partially unraveled and magnified, revealing histone proteins wound around the DNA double helix. Histones are proteins around which DNA winds for compaction and gene regulation. Methylation of DNA and chemical modification of histone tails are known as epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes alter the spacing of nucleosomes and change gene expression. Epigenetic changes may result from development, either in utero or in childhood, environmental chemicals, drugs, aging, or diet. Epigenetic changes may result in cancer, autoimmune disease, mental disorders, and diabetes.\nFigure 16.3.3\n: Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and gene expression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)\nThis type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic means “around genetics.” The changes that occur to the histone proteins and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent. Instead, these changes are temporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins and DNA. If a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene. This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription. If a gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA and transcription cannot occur (Figure 16.3.3\n).\n\nSummary\nIn eukaryotic cells, the first stage of gene expression control occurs at the epigenetic level. Epigenetic mechanisms control access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to be turned on or off. These mechanisms control how DNA is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the DNA is wound around histone proteins. The addition or removal of chemical modifications (or flags) to histone proteins or DNA signals to the cell to open or close a chromosomal region. Therefore, eukaryotic cells can control whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to transcription factors and the binding of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.\n\n16.4: Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation\nLike prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene.\n\nLike prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.\n\nThe Promoter and the Transcription Machinery\nGenes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription.\n\nWithin the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. This box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the TATA box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>NIH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Institutes of Health, a organization that provides credit for modification of work)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Enzyme that initiates transcription)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTONE PROTEINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Proteins that DNA winds around for compaction and gene regulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that contains genetic instructions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN CELLS<|>GEO<|>Cells that have eukaryotic transcription gene regulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROKARYOTIC CELLS<|>GEO<|>Cells that have different transcription gene regulation compared to eukaryotic cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TFIID<|>PERSON<|>Transcription factor that binds to the TATA box)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TFIIB<|>PERSON<|>Transcription factor that is recruited by TFIID)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TFIIE<|>PERSON<|>Transcription factor that is recruited by TFIID)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TFIIF<|>PERSON<|>Transcription factor that is recruited by TFIID)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TFIIH<|>PERSON<|>Transcription factor that is recruited by TFIID)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIH<|>RNA POLYMERASE<|>NIH provides credit for modification of work related to RNA polymerase<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTONE PROTEINS<|>DNA<|>Histone proteins and DNA interact to control gene expression<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN CELLS<|>HISTONE PROTEINS<|>Eukaryotic cells have histone proteins that control gene expression<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROKARYOTIC CELLS<|>RNA POLYMERASE<|>Prokaryotic cells have different transcription gene regulation compared to eukaryotic cells<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TFIID<|>TATA BOX<|>TFIID binds to the TATA box to initiate transcription<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TFIID<|>TFIIB<|>TFIID recruits TFIIB to the TATA box<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TFIID<|>TFIIE<|>TFIID recruits TFIIE to the TATA box<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TFIID<|>TFIIF<|>TFIID recruits TFIIF to the TATA box<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TFIID<|>TFIIH<|>TFIID recruits TFIIH to the TATA box<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RNA POLYMERASE<|>TFIID<|>RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex with TFIID<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
