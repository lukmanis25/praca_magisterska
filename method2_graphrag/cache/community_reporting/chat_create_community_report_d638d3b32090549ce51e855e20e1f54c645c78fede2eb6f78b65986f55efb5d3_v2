This process involves the translation of genetic information from a gene into a functional product, such as a protein, that can perform a specific function in an organism. Through gene expression, the information stored in a gene's DNA is used to synthesize a specific product, which can then be used by the cell to perform various functions.\n\nIn this summary, I have concatenated the two descriptions provided, resolving any potential contradictions and providing a single, coherent description of gene expression.

This characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells allows for the regulation of gene expression at many different levels. In other words, the presence of a nucleus enables the cell to control the expression of its genes through various mechanisms, ensuring that the right genes are turned on or off at the right time. This complex regulation is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells, distinguishing them from prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus and have a more straightforward gene expression process.
