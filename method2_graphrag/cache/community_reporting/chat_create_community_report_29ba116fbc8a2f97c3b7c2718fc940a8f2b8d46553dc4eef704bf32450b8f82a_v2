Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n187,MRNA,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data provided:\n\nMRNA (messenger RNA) is a type of RNA molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis. It is a mature, processed RNA molecule ready for translation, playing a crucial role in the central dogma of molecular biology. MRNA molecules carry genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where the information is used to build proteins. This process is essential for the expression of genetic traits and the development of living organisms.\n\nIn summary, MRNA is a molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, facilitating the translation of genetic code into proteins. Its mature and processed form ensures that the genetic information is accurately conveyed, allowing for the proper synthesis of proteins.\n\nNote: The descriptions provided were largely consistent, with some minor variations in wording. I have concatenated the information to provide a comprehensive and coherent summary, resolving any minor contradictions to ensure a clear and accurate description of MRNA.\",16\n188,POLY-A TAIL,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe Poly-A tail is a protective structure added to messenger RNA (mRNA) during processing. It is a long chain of adenine nucleotides attached to the 3' end of RNA, playing a crucial role in preventing the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. This tail is essential for maintaining the integrity of the RNA molecule, ensuring that it remains stable and functional throughout its lifespan. By protecting the 3' end of the RNA, the Poly-A tail prevents degradation and promotes the successful transmission of genetic information.\n\nNote: The descriptions provided are consistent and complementary, and I have concatenated them into a single, coherent summary that includes all the relevant information.\",3\n303,AUG,\"Here is the comprehensive summary:\n\nAUG is a start codon that initiates protein synthesis, serving as the initiator codon that starts protein synthesis.\",2\n227,POLYNUCLEOTIDE,Polynucleotide is a chain of nucleotides,1\n306,40S RIBOSOMAL SUBUNIT,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe 40S ribosomal subunit is a component of the ribosome that plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis. It binds to messenger RNA (mRNA) and forms part of the initiation complex, which is responsible for recruiting the necessary factors for translation to occur. As the smaller of the two subunits that make up the ribosome, the 40S subunit is essential for the recognition and binding of mRNA, allowing the ribosome to accurately translate the genetic code into a specific sequence of amino acids. Through its role in the initiation complex, the 40S subunit helps to position the mRNA correctly, ensuring that the ribosome reads the genetic code in the correct frame and translates it into a functional protein.\",3\n307,60S RIBOSOMAL SUBUNIT,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe 60S ribosomal subunit is a crucial component of the ribosome, a complex molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis. This large subunit plays a vital role in the translation of RNA into protein by binding to the 40S subunit, forming a functional ribosome. Additionally, the 60S ribosomal subunit is involved in the initiation of protein synthesis by binding to the initiation complex, which is responsible for recognizing and positioning the RNA molecule for translation. Through its interactions with the 40S subunit and the initiation complex, the 60S ribosomal subunit facilitates the translation of RNA into protein, enabling the cell to synthesize the proteins necessary for its survival and function.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n183,MRNA,POLY-A TAIL,Poly-A tail is a structure added to mRNA during processing,19\n330,MRNA,AUG,AUG is a start codon on mRNA that initiates protein synthesis,18\n220,MRNA,POLYNUCLEOTIDE,mRNA is a type of polynucleotide,17\n332,40S RIBOSOMAL SUBUNIT,60S RIBOSOMAL SUBUNIT,The 60S ribosomal subunit binds to the 40S subunit during translation elongation,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
