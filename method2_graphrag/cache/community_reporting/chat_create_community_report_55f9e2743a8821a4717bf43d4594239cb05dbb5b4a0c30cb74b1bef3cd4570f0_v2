These ancient organisms are believed to be the origin of RNA editing. They are characterized by their circular chromosomes, which distinguish them from other types of cells. Prokaryotes are also capable of undergoing DNA replication, a fundamental process that allows them to reproduce and thrive. As a type of organism, prokaryotes have evolved over time to develop unique characteristics that enable them to survive and adapt to their environments. Despite lacking a true nucleus, prokaryotes are able to carry out essential cellular functions, including DNA replication, which is crucial for their survival and propagation. Overall, prokaryotes are fascinating organisms that have played a significant role in the evolution of life on Earth.\",13\n199,NUCLEOID,Nucleoid is the central region of a prokaryotic cell where DNA resides>,2\n113,DNA POL I,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nDNA POL I is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in prokaryotic DNA replication. In addition to its replication function, it is also involved in DNA repair. This enzyme is essential for the maintenance of genome stability in prokaryotic cells, as it helps to ensure the accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division. Furthermore, its role in DNA repair enables it to correct errors that may occur during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations and maintaining genome integrity. Overall, DNA POL I is a vital enzyme that performs dual functions in prokaryotic cells, facilitating both DNA replication and repair.\",1\n114,DNA POL II,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nDNA POL II is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Primarily, it is involved in prokaryotic DNA replication, where it facilitates the synthesis of new DNA strands. Additionally, DNA POL II is also implicated in DNA repair mechanisms, suggesting its importance in maintaining genome stability. This enzyme's dual functionality underscores its significance in ensuring the integrity and fidelity of genetic information.\",1\n115,DNA POL III,\"Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nDNA POL III is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in prokaryotic DNA replication. Specifically, it is required for DNA synthesis, which is an essential process by which cells make copies of their genetic material. As a key enzyme involved in this process, DNA POL III is responsible for facilitating the synthesis of new DNA strands from template strands. This enzyme is essential for the replication of prokaryotic DNA, which is a fundamental process that occurs in cells of prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria. In summary, DNA POL III is a vital enzyme that enables the synthesis of new DNA molecules during prokaryotic DNA replication.\",1\n211,ARCHAEA,Archaea are a type of prokaryote that have a covalently closed circle chromosome,1\n224,PLASMIDS,Plasmids are shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n216,PROKARYOTES,NUCLEOID,Nucleoid is the central region of the cell where prokaryotic DNA resides,15\n106,PROKARYOTES,DNA POL I,DNA pol I is involved in prokaryotic DNA replication,14\n107,PROKARYOTES,DNA POL II,DNA pol II is involved in prokaryotic DNA replication,14\n108,PROKARYOTES,DNA POL III,DNA pol III is involved in prokaryotic DNA replication,14\n203,ARCHAEA,PROKARYOTES,Prokaryotes include archaea,14\n215,PROKARYOTES,PLASMIDS,Plasmids are found in prokaryotes,14\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
