As a primary transcript, it requires processing before it can be translated into protein. The PRE-mRNA molecule has a specific structure, consisting of four exons separated by three introns. This structure allows for alternative splicing, which enables the creation of two different proteins from a single PRE-mRNA molecule. Through the process of splicing, the introns are removed, and the exons are joined together in different combinations to form different mRNA molecules, each encoding a distinct protein. This process of alternative splicing increases the diversity of proteins that can be generated from a single gene, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability in gene expression. Overall, PRE-mRNA plays a critical role in the central dogma of molecular biology, serving as the intermediate step between transcription and translation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799749, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_537226c3ca", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.496688253, "prompt_time": 0.023171884, "completion_time": 0.58803779, "total_time": 0.611209674}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x3zypf0kt60sdymt6a0pg"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
