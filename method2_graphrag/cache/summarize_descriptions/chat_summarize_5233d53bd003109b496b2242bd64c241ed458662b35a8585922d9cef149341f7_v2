It is composed of DNA and is linearly arranged on chromosomes, specifying sequences of amino acids. The process of transcribing DNA into RNA, known as gene expression, allows the genetic information encoded in the gene to be converted into a form that can be used by the cell. This process is essential for the synthesis of proteins, which are the building blocks of all living organisms. Through gene expression, genes provide the instructions for the development, growth, and function of an organism, and their dysregulation can lead to various diseases and disorders.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799646, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_537226c3ca", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.183914439, "prompt_time": 0.022711407, "completion_time": 0.391059405, "total_time": 0.413770812}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x0vs4e01t6j3j1wrncp1e"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
