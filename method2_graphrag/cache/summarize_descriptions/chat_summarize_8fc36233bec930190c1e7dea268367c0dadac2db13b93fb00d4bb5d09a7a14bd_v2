Similar to Southern blotting, Northern blotting involves the separation of RNA molecules on a gel, rather than DNA. This technique is employed to study the expression of specific genes, allowing researchers to identify and quantify the RNA transcripts present in a sample. By doing so, Northern blotting provides valuable insights into the regulation of gene expression, enabling the investigation of various biological processes and disease mechanisms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799819, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_537226c3ca", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 286, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.375884054, "prompt_time": 0.022713148, "completion_time": 0.331718017, "total_time": 0.354431165}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x64m2e4p92azcm791km5t"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
