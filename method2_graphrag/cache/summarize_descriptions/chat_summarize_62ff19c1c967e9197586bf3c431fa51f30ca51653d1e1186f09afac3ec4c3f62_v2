Specifically, it plays a central role in transcribing nuclear pre-mRNAs in the nucleus, which are then processed to form mature mRNAs that code for proteins. This enzyme is essential for the expression of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic cells, facilitating the synthesis of proteins that perform a wide range of biological functions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799735, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_de9fa14705", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 96, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 278, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.163079105, "prompt_time": 0.022379223, "completion_time": 0.291380474, "total_time": 0.313759697}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x3jzxemra5vvgbak6zftm"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
