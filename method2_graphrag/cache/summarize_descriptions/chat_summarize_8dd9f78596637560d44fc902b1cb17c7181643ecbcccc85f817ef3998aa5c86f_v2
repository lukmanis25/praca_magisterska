This recommendation is based on the Task Force's thorough review of the available evidence, which suggests that the potential harms of PSA-based screening outweigh the benefits for healthy men. By advising against the use of PSA testing for healthy men, the Task Force aims to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which can lead to unnecessary biopsies, surgeries, and other interventions that can have negative impacts on quality of life. The Task Force's recommendation is specifically targeted at healthy men, and does not apply to men who have symptoms or risk factors for prostate cancer.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799879, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_537226c3ca", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.356467888, "prompt_time": 0.031347443, "completion_time": 0.545912211, "total_time": 0.577259654}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x7z5peryr886a2vbfpdnc"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
