Pre-mRNA, also known as precursor mRNA, is the initial transcript of a gene that undergoes several modifications to form mature mRNA (MRNA). This processing involves splicing and other modifications that transform the pre-mRNA molecules into mature mRNA molecules. Through this process, the pre-mRNA is refined to remove introns and other non-coding regions, resulting in a mature mRNA molecule that is ready for translation into protein. In essence, pre-mRNA is the precursor to mature mRNA, and the processing of pre-mRNA is a crucial step in the central dogma of molecular biology, where genetic information is passed from DNA to proteins.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799941, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_537226c3ca", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.578344546, "prompt_time": 0.030215572, "completion_time": 0.545849605, "total_time": 0.576065177}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x9txef57afz6brcfyspdz"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
