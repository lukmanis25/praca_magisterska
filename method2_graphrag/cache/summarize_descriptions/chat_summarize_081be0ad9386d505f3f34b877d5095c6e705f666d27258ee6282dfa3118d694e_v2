It is a long chain of adenine nucleotides attached to the 3' end of RNA, playing a crucial role in preventing the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. This tail is essential for maintaining the integrity of the RNA molecule, ensuring that it remains stable and functional throughout its lifespan. By protecting the 3' end of the RNA, the Poly-A tail prevents degradation and promotes the successful transmission of genetic information.\n\nNote: The descriptions provided are consistent and complementary, and I have concatenated them into a single, coherent summary that includes all the relevant information.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799672, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_de9fa14705", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.162238018, "prompt_time": 0.023906006, "completion_time": 0.463160404, "total_time": 0.48706641}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x1ngke0ktw4nhqqpsmavz"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
