It is a sequence of DNA that carries information from DNA to proteins, encoding proteins and other functional products. As a unit of heredity in a living organism, a gene plays a crucial role in the transmission of traits from one generation to the next. The gene is transcribed and translated into a functional product, which can be a protein or RNA molecule that performs a specific function in the cell. In essence, a gene is a self-contained unit of heredity that contains the instructions for creating a specific product, and its sequence determines the characteristics of that product.\n\nNote: I resolved the contradictions by selecting the most comprehensive and accurate descriptions, and combining them into a single coherent summary.
