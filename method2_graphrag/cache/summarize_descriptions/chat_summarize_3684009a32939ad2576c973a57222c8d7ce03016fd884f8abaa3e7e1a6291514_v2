This process involves the translation of genetic information from a gene into a functional product, such as a protein, that can perform a specific function in an organism. Through gene expression, the information stored in a gene's DNA is used to synthesize a specific product, which can then be used by the cell to perform various functions.\n\nIn this summary, I have concatenated the two descriptions provided, resolving any potential contradictions and providing a single, coherent description of gene expression.
