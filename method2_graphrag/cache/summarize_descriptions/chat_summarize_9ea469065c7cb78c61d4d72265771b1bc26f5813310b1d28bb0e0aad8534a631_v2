It is formed by the translation of mRNA into a polypeptide chain, a process known as translation. As a result, proteins are synthesized from mRNA during this process. They are biomolecules that play a crucial role in the cell, performing a wide range of functions. These functions include mediating cell death pathways, among others. As the final products of gene expression, proteins are responsible for carrying out various cellular functions. In essence, proteins are essential molecules that are involved in numerous cellular processes, making them a vital component of cellular biology.\n\nNote: I have resolved any contradictions by combining the descriptions in a way that provides a coherent and comprehensive summary.
