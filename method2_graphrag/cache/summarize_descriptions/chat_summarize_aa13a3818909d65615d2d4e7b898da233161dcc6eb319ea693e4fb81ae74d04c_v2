These genes code for functional proteins or RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. In other words, the genes within DNA provide the instructions for creating proteins or functional RNA molecules that perform various biological functions. DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes, which are made up of DNA and genes. This organization is crucial for the storage and transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.\n\nIn summary, DNA is a complex molecule that contains genes, which code for proteins or functional RNA molecules, and is organized into chromosomes. This intricate structure is essential for the proper functioning of living organisms.\n\nNote: The descriptions provided are not contradictory, and they all convey complementary information about the relationship between DNA and genes.
