This field of research focuses on understanding the structure, function, and evolution of genomes, which are the complete sets of genetic information contained within an organism's DNA. By examining the entire genome, genomics aims to identify patterns, relationships, and variations that can provide insights into the biology, behavior, and diversity of organisms.
