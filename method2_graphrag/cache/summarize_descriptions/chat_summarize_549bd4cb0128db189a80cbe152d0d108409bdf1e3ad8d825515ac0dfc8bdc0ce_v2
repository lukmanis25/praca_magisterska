It is a mature, processed RNA molecule ready for translation, playing a crucial role in the central dogma of molecular biology. MRNA molecules carry genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where the information is used to build proteins. This process is essential for the expression of genetic traits and the development of living organisms.\n\nIn summary, MRNA is a molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, facilitating the translation of genetic code into proteins. Its mature and processed form ensures that the genetic information is accurately conveyed, allowing for the proper synthesis of proteins.\n\nNote: The descriptions provided were largely consistent, with some minor variations in wording. I have concatenated the information to provide a comprehensive and coherent summary, resolving any minor contradictions to ensure a clear and accurate description of MRNA.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799670, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_de9fa14705", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 276, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.161894199, "prompt_time": 0.028878885, "completion_time": 0.562536559, "total_time": 0.591415444}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36x1jpbez18em0dfnjn3w12"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
