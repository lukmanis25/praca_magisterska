This method, also known as the chain termination method, is a groundbreaking technique used to determine the order of nucleotide bases in a DNA molecule. Sanger's innovative approach has had a profound impact on the field of genetics and molecular biology, enabling researchers to rapidly and accurately sequence DNA molecules. Through his work, Sanger has made significant contributions to our understanding of genetic information and has paved the way for numerous advances in fields such as genomics, genetic engineering, and biotechnology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1755799537, "model": "llama3-70b-8192", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "on_demand", "system_fingerprint": "fp_de9fa14705", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 297, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null, "queue_time": 0.161905713, "prompt_time": 0.02258376, "completion_time": 0.380186697, "total_time": 0.402770457}, "usage_breakdown": null, "x_groq": {"id": "req_01k36wxh8dewhtg8xh31qmpbtv"}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
